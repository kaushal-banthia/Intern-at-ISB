                                                                 March 19, 1998
 
  A proxy in the accompanying form is solicited by the Board of Directors of
TEXAS UTILITIES COMPANY for use at the annual meeting of shareholders to be
held in the Alexandria Auditorium of the Infomart, 1950 Stemmons Freeway,
Dallas, Texas, on Friday, May 8, 1998, at 9:30 a.m. and any adjournments
thereof for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice.
 
  The close of business on March 9, 1998 has been fixed as the time as of
which shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote with respect to, this
meeting shall be determined. At such date there were outstanding and entitled
to vote 245,237,688 shares of common stock. Except as indicated below, each
share is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to shareholders.
 
  Any shareholder may exercise the right of cumulative voting in the election
of directors provided the shareholder gives written notice of such intention
to the Secretary of the Company on or before the date preceding the election.
When exercising this right the shareholder is entitled to one vote for each
share held multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and he may cast
all of his votes for a single nominee or spread his votes among the nominees
in any manner desired.
 
  This Notice, Proxy Statement and form of proxy are being mailed or given to
shareholders on or about March 19, 1998.
 
  The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to
use of the mails, proxies may be solicited by directors, officers and regular
employees of the Company in person or by telephone. The Company has hired D.
F. King & Co., Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated
cost of $7,500 plus disbursements. Shareholders may assist the Company in
avoiding expenses in this connection by returning their proxies promptly.
 
                                       1
<PAGE>
 
  Any proxy delivered pursuant to this solicitation is revocable at the option
of the person executing the same at any time prior to the exercise thereof.
The shares represented by any proxy duly given as a result of this request
will be voted in the discretion of the persons named in the proxy unless the
shareholder specifies a choice by means of the ballot space on the proxy, in
which case the shares will be voted accordingly.
 
  The Company has adopted a confidential voting policy. Accordingly,
tabulation of proxies and votes cast at the meeting will be conducted by an
independent agent and the votes of individual shareholders will be kept
private and not disclosed to the Company, except in limited circumstances.
 
  The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the
shares of the common stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum entitled
to transact business at the meeting. Directors are elected by plurality vote
of the votes cast at the meeting; abstentions and non-votes, as described
below, will have no effect. The approval of the selection of auditors requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting;
abstentions and non-votes, i.e. shares held by brokers and other nominees or
fiduciaries that are present at the meeting but not voted on such matter, will
be treated as negative votes.
 
                  1999 ANNUAL MEETING SHAREHOLDERS' PROPOSALS
 
  All proposals from shareholders to be considered at the next annual meeting
scheduled for May 21, 1999 must be received by the Secretary of the Company,
Energy Plaza, 1601 Bryan Street, Dallas, Texas 75201-3411, not later than the
close of business on November 19, 1998.
 
                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 
  It is the intent of the Board of Directors that the persons named in the
proxy will vote your shares in favor of the nominees for directors listed
hereafter, unless authority is withheld. All of the nominees are current
members of the Board of Directors and have been nominated by the Nominating
Committee. The persons named in the proxy may cumulate the votes represented
thereby and in case any such nominee shall become unavailable, which the Board
of Directors has no reason to anticipate, may vote for a substitute.

  During 1997 the Board of Directors held five meetings. The standing
committees of the Board of Directors and the membership of each committee are
shown on the preceding pages. During 1997 each of the Directors attended more
than 92% of the aggregate of the Board of Directors meetings and the meetings
of the Committees on which they serve.
 
  The Audit Committee nominates to the Board, for approval by the shareholders
at each annual meeting, a firm of independent auditors to audit the books of
account and records of the Company and to perform such other duties as this
Committee may prescribe or approve, receives the reports and comments from
such independent auditors, reviews the adequacy of internal controls, reviews
the accounting principles employed in financial reporting and takes any action
with respect thereto as it may deem appropriate, reports to the Board of
Directors upon its findings and recommendations and performs such other duties
as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Board; the Audit Committee
held three meetings during 1997. The Executive Committee exercises the
authority of the Board in the intervals between meetings of the Board; the
Executive Committee did not meet during 1997. The Finance Committee reviews
and recommends to the Board, for its consideration, major financial
undertakings and policies and performs such other duties as may be assigned to
it from time to time by the Board; the Finance Committee held two meetings
during 1997. The Nominating Committee selects and recommends to the Board, for
its consideration, persons as nominees for election as directors of the
Company and performs such other duties as may be assigned to it from time to
time by the Board; the Nominating Committee held one meeting in 1997.
Shareholders may recommend nominees for directors to the Nominating Committee
by writing to the Secretary of the Company, Energy Plaza, 1601 Bryan Street,
Dallas, Texas 75201-3411. The Nuclear Committee reviews, generally oversees,
and makes reports and recommendations to the Board in connection with, the
operation of the Company's nuclear generating units; the Nuclear Committee
held seven meetings during 1997. The Organization and Compensation Committee
reviews and establishes the duties, titles and remuneration of officers of the
Company; the Organization and Compensation Committee held three meetings in
1997. A Business Development Committee was established by the Board in 1997.
The Business Development Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, for
its consideration, new business opportunities, proposed acquisitions and other
transactions and performs such other duties as may be assigned to it from time
to time by the Board; the Business Development Committee held three meetings
during 1997.
 
  Non-officer directors were compensated in 1997 by a retainer fee at the
annual rate of $25,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting attended and $1,000
for each committee meeting attended. Additionally, non-officer directors who
are members of the Nuclear Committee receive an annual retainer fee of $10,000
for their services on that Committee. Directors who are officers of the
Company do not receive any fees for service as a director.
 
                                       5

All directors are reimbursed for expenses. Non-officer directors may elect to
defer, in increments of 25%, all or a portion of their annual Board retainer
pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors (Directors'
Plan). Amounts deferred are matched by the Company. Under the Directors' Plan,
a trustee purchases Company common stock with an amount of cash equal to each
participant's deferred retainer and matching amount, and accounts are
established for each participant containing performance units equal to such
number of common shares. Directors' Plan investments, including reinvested
dividends, are restricted to Company common stock. On the expiration of the
applicable maturity period (not fewer than three nor more than ten years, as
selected by the participant) or upon death or disability while serving as a
director, the value of the participant's accounts is paid in cash based on the
then current value of the performance units.
 
              BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY
 
  Each nominee for director and certain executive officers reported beneficial
ownership of common stock of the Company, as of the date hereof, as follows:

(1) Share units held in deferred compensation accounts under the Deferred and
    Incentive Compensation Plan or the Directors' Plan. Although these plans
    allow such units to be paid only in the form of cash, investments in such
    units create essentially the same investment stake in the performance of
    the Company's common stock as do investments in actual shares of common
    stock.
 
(2) In addition to the shares reported above, clients of Mr. Friedman's
    investment advisory firm own 1,480 shares of the common stock of the
    Company. Mr. Friedman disclaims any beneficial interest in such shares.
 
  The named individuals have voting and investment power for the shares of
common stock reported as Beneficially Owned. Ownership of such common stock by
each individual director and executive officer and for all directors and
executive officers as a group constituted less than 1% of the Company's
outstanding shares.
 
  The Company has no knowledge of any person who beneficially owned more than
5% of the common stock of the Company as of December 31, 1997. Mellon Bank,
N.A. (Mellon), held as of such date in its capacity as Trustee of the
Employees' Thrift Plan of the Texas Utilities Company System (Thrift Plan), a
total of 12,259,617 shares of the Company's common stock, or 5.0% of the
outstanding common shares, of which 6,879,589 shares, or 2.8% of the
outstanding shares, have been allocated to Thrift Plan participants' accounts.
Thrift Plan participants are entitled to direct Mellon as to how to vote
shares allocated to their accounts and Mellon disclaims beneficial ownership
of such allocated shares.

(1) Amounts reported as Bonus in the Summary Compensation Table are
    attributable to the named officer's participation in the Annual Incentive
    Plan (AIP). Elected corporate officers of the Company and its
    participating subsidiaries with a title of Vice President or above are
    eligible to participate in the AIP. Under the terms of the AIP, target
    incentive awards ranging from 35% to 50% of base salary, and a maximum
    award of 100% of base salary, are established. The percentage of the
    target or the maximum actually awarded, if any, is dependent upon the
    attainment of per share net income goals established in advance by the
    Organization and Compensation Committee
 
                                       8

    (Committee) as well as the Committee's evaluation of the participant's and
    the Company's performance. One-half of each such award is paid in cash and
    is reflected as Bonus in the Summary Compensation Table. Payment of the
    remainder of the award is deferred under the Deferred and Incentive
    Compensation Plan (DICP) discussed hereinafter in footnote (2).
 
(2) Amounts reported as Long-Term Compensation are attributable to the named
    officer's participation in the DICP. Elected corporate officers of the
    Company and its participating subsidiaries with the title of Vice
    President or above are eligible to participate in the DICP. Participants
    in the DICP may defer a percentage of their base salary not to exceed a
    maximum percentage determined by the Committee for each Plan year and in
    any event not to exceed 15% of the participant's base salary. The Company
    makes a matching award (Matching Award) equal to 150% of the participant's
    deferred salary. In addition, one-half of any AIP award (Incentive Award)
    is deferred and invested under the DICP. The Matching Awards and Incentive
    Awards are subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances. Under the
    DICP, a trustee purchases Company common stock with an amount of cash
    equal to each participant's deferred salary, Matching Award and Incentive
    Award, and accounts are established for each participant containing
    performance units (Units) equal to such number of common shares. DICP
    investments, including reinvested dividends, are restricted to Company
    common stock. On the expiration of the applicable maturity period (three
    years for the Incentive Awards and five years for deferred salary and
    Matching Awards), the values of the participant's accounts are paid in
    cash based upon the then current value of the Units; provided, however,
    that in no event will a participant's account be deemed to have a cash
    value which is less than the sum of such participant's deferred salary
    together with a 6% per annum (compounded annually) interest equivalent
    thereon. The maturity period is waived if the participant dies or becomes
    totally and permanently disabled and may be extended under certain
    circumstances.
 
    Incentive Awards and Matching Awards that have been made under the DICP are
    included under Restricted Stock Awards in the Summary Compensation Table for
    each of the last three years. As a result of these awards, undistributed
    Incentive Awards and Matching Awards made under the DICP in prior years, and
    dividends reinvested thereon, the number and market value of such Units at
    December 31, 1997 (each of which is equal to one share of common stock) held
    in the DICP accounts for Messrs. Nye, Farrington, Gibbs, Taylor and McNally
    were 39,725 ($1,648,588), 36,466 ($1,513,339), 17,134 ($711,061), 15,597
    ($647,276) and 8,299 ($344,409), respectively.

    The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (LTICP) is a comprehensive, stock-
    based incentive compensation plan providing for discretionary grants of
    common stock-based awards, including restricted stock. Outstanding awards to
    named executive officers vest over a three year period and such executive
    officers may earn from 0% to 200% of the number of shares awarded based on
    the Company's total return to shareholders over such three year period
    compared to the total return provided by the companies comprising the
    Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index. Dividends are paid and reinvested
    on such restricted stock awards at the same rate as dividends on the
    Company's common stock. As a result of restricted stock awards under the
    LTICP, and dividends reinvested thereon, the number of shares of restricted
    stock and the value of such shares at December 31, 1997 held for Messrs.
    Nye, Farrington, Gibbs, Taylor and McNally were 22,666 ($940,639),-0-
    ($-0-), 5,151 ($213,767), 4,121 ($171,022) and 11,333 ($470,320),
    respectively.
 
    Salary deferred under the DICP is included in amounts reported as Salary in
    the Summary Compensation Table. Amounts shown in the table below represent
    the number of shares purchased under the DICP with such deferred salaries
    for 1997 and the number of shares awarded under the LTICP:

    Under the Employees' Thrift Plan of the Texas Utilities Company System
    (Thrift Plan) all employees with at least six months of eligible service
    with the Company or any of its participating subsidiaries may invest up to
    16% of their regular salary or wages in common stock of the Company, or in a
    variety of selected mutual funds. Under the Thrift Plan, the Company matches
    a portion of an employee's savings in an amount equal to 40%, 50% or 60%
    (depending on the employee's length of service) of the first 6% of such
    employee's savings. All matching amounts are invested in common stock of the
    Company. The amounts reported under All Other Compensation in the Summary
    Compensation Table include these matching amounts which, for Messrs. Nye,
    Farrington, Gibbs, Taylor and McNally amounted to $5,760, $5,760, $4,800,
    $5,760 and $3,840, respectively, during 1997.
 
    The Company has a Salary Deferral Program (Program) under which each
    employee of the Company and its participating subsidiaries whose annual
    salary is equal to or greater than an amount established under the Program
    ($94,760 for the Program Year beginning April 1997) may elect to defer a
    percentage of annual salary for a period of seven years, a period ending
    with the retirement of such employee, or for a combination thereof. Such
    deferrals may not exceed in the aggregate 10% of the employee's annual
    salary. Salary deferred under the Program is included in amounts reported
    under Salary in the Summary Compensation Table. The Company makes a matching
    award, subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances, equal to 100% of
    the salary deferred under the Program. The trustee for the Program
    distributes, at the end of the applicable maturity period, cash equal to the
    greater of the actual earnings of Program assets, or the average yield
    during the applicable maturity period of U. S. Treasury Notes with a
    maturity of ten years. The distribution of the amounts due under the Program
    is in a lump sum if the maturity period is seven years or, if the retirement
    option is elected, in twenty annual installments. The Company is financing
    the retirement portion of the Program through the purchase of corporate-
    owned life insurance on the lives of the participants. The proceeds from
    such insurance are expected to allow the Company to fully recover the cost
    of the retirement option. During 1997, matching awards, which are included
    under All Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table, were made
    for Messrs. Nye, Farrington, Gibbs, Taylor and McNally in the amounts of
    $76,042, $63,989, $35,458, $33,958 and $27,917, respectively.
 
    Under the Split-Dollar Life Insurance Program of the Texas Utilities Company
    System (Insurance Program), split-dollar life insurance policies are
    purchased for elected corporate officers of the Company and its
    participating subsidiaries with a title of Vice President or above, with a
    death benefit equal to four times their annual Insurance Program
    compensation. New participants vest in the policies issued under the
 
                                      11

    Insurance Program over a six year period. The Company pays the premiums for
    these policies and has received a collateral assignment of the policies
    equal in value to the sum of all of its insurance premium payments. Although
    the Insurance Program is terminable at any time, it is designed so that if
    it is continued, the Company will fully recover all of the insurance premium
    payments it has made either upon the death of the participant or, if the
    assumptions made as to policy yield are realized, upon the later of fifteen
    years of participation or the participant's attainment of age sixty-five.
    During 1997, the economic benefit derived by Messrs. Nye, Farrington, Gibbs,
    Taylor and McNally from the term insurance coverage provided and the
    interest foregone on the remainder of the insurance premiums paid by the
    Company amounted to $62,161, $71,072, $25,968, $20,230 and $5,582,
    respectively.
 
    The amount of $66,291 included in the All Other Compensation column of the
    Summary Compensation Table for Mr. McNally for 1997 represents additional
    compensation that the Company agreed to pay Mr. McNally incident to his
    employment with the Company in lieu of payments he would have received from
    a prior employer.
 
(4) Mr. Farrington has a management transition agreement with the Company
    pursuant to which he remained as Chairman of the Board until May 1997, at
    which time he was named Chairman Emeritus. He will retire as an active
    employee in May 1998 and serve thereafter as a consultant to the Company
    for a two year period. In accordance with the agreement, during the period
    from May 1996 until his retirement, Mr. Farrington's salary will be
    reduced by 15% each year, and he will be eligible to participate in all
    employee benefit plans of the Company. As a consultant, he will receive
    $200,000 annually.

  The Company and its subsidiaries maintain retirement plans (Plans) which are
qualified under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (Code). Annual retirement benefits are computed as follows: for each
year of accredited service up to a total of 40 years of service, 1.3% of the
first $7,800, plus 1.5% of the excess over $7,800 of the participant's average
annual earnings during his or her three years of highest earnings. Amounts
reported under Salary for the named officers in the Summary Compensation Table
approximate earnings as defined by the Plans and the Supplemental Retirement
Plan (Supplemental Plan). Benefits paid under the Plans are not subject to any
reduction for Social Security payments but are limited by provisions of the
Code. The Supplemental Plan provides for the payment of retirement benefits
which would otherwise be limited by the Code or by the definition of earnings
in the Plans. Under the Supplemental Plan, retirement benefits are calculated
in accordance with the same formula used under the Plans, except that earnings
also include AIP awards (50% of the AIP award is reported under Bonus for the
named officers in the Summary Compensation Table). As of February 28, 1998,
years of accredited service under the plans for Messrs. Nye, Farrington, Gibbs,
Taylor and McNally were 35, 38, 35, 30 and 1, respectively. The table
illustrates the total annual benefit payable at retirement under the Plans and
Supplemental Plan prior to any reduction for a contingent beneficiary option
which may be selected by the participant.

                ORGANIZATION AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
                           ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
  The Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
(Committee) is responsible for reviewing and establishing the compensation of
the executive officers of the Company. The Committee consists of all of the
nonemployee directors of the Company and is chaired by James A. Middleton. The
Committee has directed the preparation of this report and has approved its
contents and submission to the shareholders.
 
  As a matter of policy, the Committee believes that levels of executive
compensation should be based upon an evaluation of the performance of the
Company and its officers generally, as well as in comparison to persons with
comparable responsibilities in similar business enterprises. Compensation
plans should align executive compensation with returns to shareholders with
due consideration accorded to balancing both long-term and short-term
objectives. The overall compensation program should provide for an appropriate
and competitive balance between base salaries and performance-based annual and
long-term incentives. The Committee has determined that, as a matter of policy
to be implemented over time, the base salaries of the officers will be
established at the median, or 50th percentile, of the top ten electric
utilities in the United States and that opportunities for total direct
compensation (defined as the sum of base salaries, annual incentives and long-
term incentives) to reach the 75th percentile, or above, of such utilities
will be provided through performance-based compensation plans. Such
compensation principles and practices have allowed, and should continue to
allow, the Company to attract, retain and motivate its key executives.
 
  In furtherance of these policies, a nationally recognized compensation
consultant has been retained since 1994 to assist the Committee in its
periodic reviews of compensation and benefits provided to officers. The
consultant's evaluations include comparisons to the largest utilities as well
as to general industry with respect both to the level and composition of
officers' compensation. The consultant's recommendations including the Annual
Incentive Plan, the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and certain benefit
changes have generally been implemented. The Annual Incentive Plan, which was
approved by the shareholders in 1995, is generally referred to as the AIP and
is described in this report as well as in footnote 1 on pages 8 and 9 of this
proxy statement. The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, referred to as the
Long-Term Plan or LTICP, was approved by the shareholders in 1997 and is
described in this report as well as in footnote 2 on pages 9 and 10 of this
proxy statement.
 
                                      14

  In recent years, the compensation of the officers of the Company has
consisted principally of base salaries, the opportunity to participate in the
Deferred and Incentive Compensation Plan (referred to as the DICP and
described in footnote 2 on pages 9 and 10 of this proxy statement) and the
opportunity to earn an incentive award under the AIP. Benefits provided under
the DICP and the AIP have represented a substantial portion of officers'
compensation, and the value of future payments under the DICP, as well as the
value of the deferred portion of any award under the AIP, is directly related
to the future performance of the Company's common stock. It is anticipated
that performance-based incentive awards under the AIP and the Long-Term Plan
will, in future years, constitute an increasing percentage of the officers'
total compensation.
 
  The AIP is administered by the Committee and provides an objective framework
within which annual Company and individual performance can be evaluated by the
Committee. Depending on the results of such performance evaluations, and the
attainment of the per share net income goals established in advance, the
Committee may provide annual incentive compensation awards to eligible
officers. The evaluation of each individual participant's performance is based
upon the attainment of individual and business unit objectives. The Company's
performance is evaluated, compared to the ten largest electric utilities
and/or the electric utility industry, based upon its total return to
shareholders and return on invested capital, as well as other measures
relating to competitiveness, service quality and employee safety. The
combination of individual and Company performance results, together with the
Committee's evaluation of the competitive level of compensation which is
appropriate for such results, determines the amount, if any, actually awarded.
 
  The Long-Term Plan, which is also administered by the Committee, is a
comprehensive stock-based incentive compensation plan under which all awards
are made in, or based on the value of, the Company's common stock. The Long-
Term Plan provides that, in the discretion of the Committee, awards may be in
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance and/or
restricted stock or stock units or in any other stock-based form. The purpose
of the Long-Term Plan is to provide performance-related incentives linked to
long-term performance goals. Such performance goals may be based on individual
performance and/or may include criteria such as absolute or relative levels of
total shareholder return, revenues, sales, net income or net worth of the
Company, any of its subsidiaries, business units or other areas, all as the
Committee may determine. Awards under the Long-Term Plan are expected to
constitute the principal long-term component of officers' compensation. At its
meeting in May 1997, the Committee provided awards of performance-based
restricted stock to certain officers, including the Chief Executive. The
future value of those awards will be determined by the Company's total return
to shareholders over a three year period compared to the total return for that
period of the
 
                                      15
<PAGE>
 
companies comprising the Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index. Depending
upon the Company's relative return for such period, the officers may earn from
0% to 200% of the original award and their compensation is, thereby, directly
related to shareholder value. These awards, and any awards that may be made in
the future, are based upon the Committee's evaluation of the appropriate level
of long-term compensation consistent with its policy relating to total direct
compensation.
 
  In establishing levels of executive compensation at its May 1997 meeting,
the Committee reviewed various performance and compensation data, including
the performance measures under the AIP and the report of its compensation
consultant. Information was also gathered from industry sources and other
published and private materials which provided a basis for comparing the
largest electric and gas utilities and other survey groups representing a
large variety of business organizations. Included in the data considered was
that the Company's total return to shareholders in 1996 was 4.4%, which was
the third highest total return amongst the ten largest utilities. The
comparative returns provided by the largest electric and gas utilities are
represented by the returns of the Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index and
are reflected in the graph on page 18. The graph also reflects the returns
provided by the Moody's 24 Utilities, and that disclosure will be discontinued
after this year in light of the greater comparability of the Company to the
companies comprising such S&P index. In 1996, TU Electric, the Company's
principal subsidiary, was the largest electric utility in the United States as
measured by megawatt hour sales and, compared to other electric utilities in
the United States, was fifth in electric revenues, sixth in total assets,
fourth in net generating capability, eighth in number of customers and twelfth
in number of employees. Compensation amounts were established by the Committee
based upon its consideration of the above comparative data and its subjective
evaluation of Company and individual performance at levels consistent with the
Committee's policy relating to total direct compensation.
 
  In May 1997 the Committee increased Mr. Nye's base salary as Chief Executive
to an annual rate of $775,000 representing a $35,000 or 4.7% increase over the
amount established for Mr. Nye in May 1996. Based upon the Committee's
evaluation of individual and Company performance, as called for by the AIP,
the Committee also provided Mr. Nye with an AIP award of $650,000 compared to
the prior year's award of $370,000. The Committee also awarded 22,000 shares
of performance-based restricted stock to Mr. Nye. Under the terms of the
award, Mr. Nye can earn from 0% to 200% of the award depending on the
Company's total return to shareholders over a three-year period (April 1, 1997
through March 31, 2000) compared to the total return provided by the companies
comprising the Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index. This level of
compensation was established based upon the Committee's subjective evaluation
of the information described in this report.
 
                                      16
<PAGE>
 
  In discharging its responsibilities with respect to establishing executive
compensation, the Committee normally considers such matters at its May meeting
held in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Although Company
management may be present during Committee discussions of officers'
compensation, Committee decisions with respect to the compensation of the
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive and the President are reached in
private session without the presence of any member of Company management.
 
  Section 162(m) of the Code limits the deductibility of compensation which a
publicly traded corporation provides to its most highly compensated officers.
As a general policy, the Company does not intend to provide compensation which
is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Awards under the AIP in
1996 and subsequent years as well as awards under the Long-Term Plan are
expected to be fully deductible, and the DICP and the Salary Deferral Program
have been amended to require the deferral of distributions of amounts earned
in 1995 and subsequent years until the time when such amounts would be
deductible. Awards provided under the AIP in 1995 and distributions under the
DICP and the Salary Deferral Program which were earned in plan years prior to
1995, may not be fully deductible but such amounts are not expected to be
material.
 
  Shareholder comments to the Committee are welcomed and should be addressed
to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's offices.
