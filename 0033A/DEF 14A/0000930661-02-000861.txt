                               -----------------

                                                                 March 26, 2002

   A proxy in the accompanying form is solicited by the Board of Directors of
TXU Corp. for use at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in the
Kalita Humphreys Theater in the Dallas Theater Center, 3636 Turtle Creek
Boulevard, Dallas, Texas on Friday, May 10, 2002 at 9:30 a.m. and any
adjournments thereof for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice.

   The close of business on March 11, 2002 has been fixed as the time as of
which shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote with respect to, this
meeting shall be determined. At such date there were outstanding and entitled
to vote 266,119,825 shares of common stock. Except as indicated below, each
share is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to shareholders.

   Any shareholder may exercise the right of cumulative voting in the election
of directors provided the shareholder gives written notice of such intention to
the Secretary of the Company on or before the date preceding the election. When
exercising this right the shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share
held multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and may cast all such
votes for a single nominee or spread such votes among the nominees in any
manner desired.

   This Notice, Proxy Statement and form of proxy are being mailed or given to
shareholders on or about March 26, 2002. Since the Summary Annual Report for
2001 contains abbreviated financial information, the audited consolidated
financial statements and certain other financial information of the Company are
included in Appendix C to this proxy statement.

   The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to
use of the mails, proxies may be solicited by directors, officers and regular
employees of the Company in person or by telephone.  The Company has hired D.
F. King & Co., Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated
cost of $8,000 plus disbursements. Shareholders may assist the Company in
avoiding expenses in this connection by returning their proxies promptly.

   Any proxy delivered pursuant to this solicitation is revocable at the option
of the person executing the same at any time prior to the exercise thereof. The
shares represented by any proxy duly given as a result of this request will be
voted in the discretion of the persons named in the proxy unless the
shareholder specifies a choice by means of the ballot space on the proxy, in
which case the shares will be voted accordingly.

   The Company has adopted a confidential voting policy. Accordingly,
tabulation of proxies and votes cast at the meeting will be conducted by an
independent agent and the votes of individual shareholders will be kept private
and not disclosed to the Company, except in limited circumstances.

                                      1

<PAGE>

   The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the
shares of the common stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum entitled
to transact business at the meeting. Directors are elected by plurality vote of
the votes cast at the meeting; abstentions and non votes, as described below,
will have no effect. The approval of the amendment to the Restated Articles of
Incorporation will require the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of the
holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares. The reapproval of the
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and the selection of auditors
require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the
meeting. Abstentions and non-votes, i.e. shares held by brokers and other
nominees or fiduciaries that are present at the meeting but not voted on such
matters, will be treated as negative votes.

                  2003 ANNUAL MEETING SHAREHOLDERS' PROPOSALS

   All proposals from shareholders to be considered at the next annual meeting
scheduled for May 16, 2003 must be received by the Secretary of the Company,
1601 Bryan Street, Dallas, Texas 75201-3411, not later than the close of
business on November 26, 2002.

   In addition, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission allow the
Company to use discretionary voting authority to vote on any matter coming
before the 2003 annual meeting of shareholders that is not included in the
proxy statement for that meeting if the Company does not have notice of the
matter by February 9, 2003.

                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

   It is the intent of the Board of Directors that the persons named in the
proxy will vote your shares in favor of the nominees for directors listed
hereafter, unless authority is withheld. All of the nominees are current
members of the Board of Directors. The persons named in the proxy may cumulate
the votes represented thereby and in case any such nominee shall become
unavailable, which the Board of Directors has no reason to anticipate, may vote
for a substitute.

   The names of the nominees for the office of director for the ensuing year
and information about them, as furnished by the nominees themselves, are set
forth below:

   During 2001 the Board of Directors held four meetings. The standing
committees of the Board of Directors and the membership of each committee are
shown on the preceding pages. During 2001 each of the Directors attended 100%
of the aggregate of the Board of Directors meetings and the meetings of the
Committees on which they serve.

   The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities applicable to the Company's auditing, accounting and financial
reporting processes and the Company's system of internal control. The Committee
has developed, and the Board has adopted, a written charter which is reproduced
in Appendix B to this proxy statement. The Audit Committee held five meetings
during 2001.

   The Executive Committee exercises the authority of the Board in the
intervals between meetings of the Board. The Executive Committee did not meet
during 2001.

   The Finance Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, for its
consideration, major financial undertakings and policies and performs such
other duties as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Board. The
Finance Committee held two meetings during 2001.

   The Nominating Committee selects and recommends to the Board, for its
consideration, persons as nominees for election as directors of the Company and
performs such other duties as may be assigned to it from time to time by the
Board. The Nominating Committee held one meeting in 2001. Shareholders may
recommend nominees for directors to the Nominating Committee by writing to the
Secretary of the Company, 1601 Bryan Street, Dallas, Texas 75201-3411.

   The Nuclear Committee reviews, generally oversees, and makes reports and
recommendations to the Board in connection with the operation of the Company's
nuclear generating units. The Nuclear Committee held eight meetings during 2001.

   The Organization and Compensation Committee reviews and establishes the
duties, titles and remuneration of officers of the Company. The Organization
and Compensation Committee held three meetings in 2001.

   The Business Development Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, for
its consideration, new business opportunities, proposed acquisitions and other
transactions and performs such other duties as may be assigned to it from time
to time by the Board. The Business Development Committee held four meetings
during 2001.

   Except as described herein, directors were compensated in 2001 by a retainer
at the annual rate of $36,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting attended and
$1,000 for each Committee meeting attended. Members of the Nuclear Committee
and the Business Development Committee received annual retainers of $5,000.
Effective May 11, 2001, an annual retainer for service on the Audit Committee
was established at $2,000. Also effective May 11, 2001, an additional fee for
service as chair of each Committee meeting attended was established at $500.
Directors who are officers, or former officers, of the Company do not receive
any fees for service as a director. All directors are reimbursed for reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with their services as directors.

   Directors who receive a retainer for their service as a director may elect
to defer, in increments of 25%, all or a portion of their annual Board retainer
pursuant to the TXU Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors
(Directors' Plan). Amounts deferred are matched by the Company. Under the
Directors' Plan, a trustee purchases Company common stock with an amount of
cash equal to each participant's deferred retainer and matching amount, and
accounts are established for each participant containing performance units
equal to such number of common shares. Directors' Plan investments,

                                      5

<PAGE>

including reinvested dividends, are restricted to Company common stock. On the
expiration of the applicable maturity period (not fewer than three nor more
than ten years, as selected by the participant) or upon death or disability
while serving as a director, the value of the participant's maturing accounts
is paid in cash based on the then current value of the performance units.

   In lieu of the retainers and fees paid to other non-officer directors as
described herein, Mr. Bonham received annual compensation from the Company in
the amount of (Pounds)100,000 (approximately $145,600 based on 2001 year-end
foreign exchange rates), under the terms of an agreement which also provides
for administrative support, transportation expenses and health insurance. This
agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon three-months'
notice.

   In addition to the retainers and fees described herein, Mr. Laday provides
consulting services to the Company under an agreement which provides for a
monthly retainer of $12,000 as well as reimbursement of certain travel
expenses. The agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon
60-days' written notice. Mr. Laday was paid $144,000 during 2001 under this
agreement.

              BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY

   Each nominee for director and certain executive officers reported beneficial
ownership of common stock of the Company, as of the date hereof, as follows:

(1) Share units held in deferred compensation accounts under the Deferred and
    Incentive Compensation Plan or the Directors' Plan. Although these plans
    allow such units to be paid only in the form of cash, investments in such
    units create essentially the same investment stake in the performance of
    the Company's common stock as do investments in actual shares of common
    stock. Since he does not receive a retainer, Mr. Bonham is not eligible to
    participate in the Directors' Plan.

(2) Shares reported include 10,000 shares owned by Mr. Griffin's spouse as her
    separate property in which Mr. Griffin disclaims any beneficial interest.

  of the Company
</TABLE>
- --------

(1) Amounts reported as Bonus in the Summary Compensation Table are
    attributable to the named executive officers' participation in the TXU
    Annual Incentive Plan (AIP). Eligible officers of the Company and its
    participating subsidiaries with a title of Vice President or above
    participate in the AIP. Under the terms of the AIP as in effect for awards
    provided in 2001 and before, target incentive awards ranging from 40% to
    75% of base salary, and a maximum award of 100% of base salary, are
    established. The percentage of the target or maximum actually awarded, if
    any, is dependent upon the attainment of per share net income goals
    established in advance by the Organization and Compensation Committee
    (Committee), as well as the Committee's evaluation of the participant's and
    the Company's performance. One-half of each award is paid in cash and
    reflected as Bonus in the Summary Compensation Table, and the remainder of
    the award is deferred and invested under the TXU Deferred and Incentive
    Compensation Plan (DICP) discussed in footnote (3). The AIP was amended
    with respect to awards to be provided beginning in 2002 so as to establish
    target incentive awards ranging from 20% to 75% of base salary, while
    retaining a maximum award of 100% of base salary, and to provide for the
    payment of the entire award, if any, in cash.

(2) The amounts reported for Mr. Gibbs as Other Annual Compensation consist of
    certain benefits provided by the Company under its standard expatriate
    policy in connection with an extended assignment in the United Kingdom
    during 1999 and 2000. The amount for 2000 represents income

                                      8

<PAGE>

    taxes associated with such benefits paid on Mr. Gibbs' behalf. The amount
    for 1999 includes approximately $128,000 for housing during the assignment,
    United Kingdom income taxes paid on Mr. Gibbs' behalf and certain other
    benefits.

    The amount included in the Other Annual Compensation column for Mr. Dickie
    for 1999 represents relocation expenses paid by the Company under its
    standard employee relocation policy in connection with Mr. Dickie's
    employment with the Company.

(3) Amounts reported as Restricted Stock Awards in the Summary Compensation
    Table are attributable to the named officer's participation in the DICP.
    Elected corporate officers of the Company and its participating
    subsidiaries with the title of Vice President or above are eligible to
    participate in the DICP. Participants in the DICP may defer a percentage of
    their base salary not to exceed a maximum percentage determined by the
    Committee for each plan year and in any event not to exceed 15% of the
    participant's base salary. Salary deferred under the DICP is included in
    amounts reported as Salary in the Summary Compensation Table. The Company
    makes a matching award (Matching Award) equal to 150% of the participant's
    deferred salary. In addition, one-half of any AIP award (Incentive Award)
    is deferred and invested under the DICP. Concurrently with the change in
    the AIP providing for payment of the full amount of AIP awards in cash
    beginning in 2002, the DICP was amended to eliminate future Incentive
    Awards. Matching Awards and Incentive Awards are subject to forfeiture
    under certain circumstances. Under the DICP, a trustee purchases Company
    common stock with an amount of cash equal to each participant's deferred
    salary, Matching Award and Incentive Award, and accounts are established
    for each participant containing performance units (Units) equal to such
    number of common shares. DICP investments, including reinvested dividends,
    are restricted to Company common stock, and the value of each unit credited
    to participants' accounts equals the value of a share of Company common
    stock. On the expiration of the applicable maturity period (three years for
    Incentive Awards and five years for deferred salary and Matching Awards),
    the value of the participant's maturing accounts are paid in cash based
    upon the then current value of the Units; provided, however, that in no
    event will a participant's account be deemed to have a cash value which is
    less than the sum of such participant's deferred salary together with 6%
    per annum interest compounded annually. Beginning in 2002, participants may
    elect to defer amounts that would otherwise mature under the DICP, under
    and subject to the provisions of the Salary Deferral Program (SDP),
    discussed in footnote (5), provided that any such deferral election must be
    made at least 12 months prior to the date that the amount would otherwise
    mature under the DICP. The maturity period is waived if the participant
    dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled and may be extended under
    certain circumstances.

    Incentive Awards and Matching Awards that have been made under the DICP are
    included under Restricted Stock Awards in the Summary Compensation Table
    for each of the last three years. As a result of these awards,
    undistributed Incentive Awards and Matching Awards made under the DICP in
    prior years, and dividends reinvested thereon, the number and market value
    at December 31, 2001 of such Units (each of which is equal to one share of
    common stock) held in the DICP accounts for Messrs. Nye, Biegler, Gibbs,
    Dickie and McNally were 67,721 ($3,193,045), 29,445 ($1,388,332), 29,308
    ($1,381,872), 27,943 ($1,317,512) and 26,891 ($1,267,911), respectively.

(4) Amounts reported as LTIP Payouts in the Summary Compensation Table are
    attributable to the vesting and distribution of performance-based
    restricted stock awards under the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
    (LTICP) and the distribution during the year of earnings on salaries
    previously deferred under the DICP.

    The LTICP is a comprehensive, stock-based incentive compensation plan
    providing for discretionary grants of common stock-based awards, including
    performance-based restricted stock. Outstanding awards of performance-based
    restricted stock to the named executive officers vest at the end of a three
    year performance period and provide for an ultimate distribution of from

                                      9

<PAGE>

    0% to 200% of the number of shares initially awarded, based on the
    Company's total return to shareholders over the three year period compared
    to the total return provided by the companies comprising the Standard &
    Poor's Electric Utility Index. Dividends on restricted shares are
    reinvested in Company common stock and are paid in cash upon release of the
    restricted shares. Under the terms of the LTICP, the maximum amount of any
    award that may be paid in any one year to any of the named executive
    officers is the fair market value of 100,000 shares of the Company's common
    stock determined as of the first day of such calendar year. The portion of
    any award that, based on such limitation, cannot be fully paid in any year
    is deferred until a subsequent year when it can be paid. Based on the
    Company's total return to shareholders over the three year period ending
    March 31, 2001 compared to the returns provided by the companies comprising
    the Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index, Messrs. Nye, Biegler, Gibbs
    and McNally each received 50% of the restricted shares awarded in May of
    1998, which stock was valued at $487,190, $155,015, $110,725 and $243,595,
    respectively.

    Amounts reported also include earnings distributed during the year on
    salaries previously deferred under the DICP for Messrs. Nye, Gibbs and
    McNally of $32,557, $28,196 and $20,732, respectively.

    As a result of restricted stock awards under the LTICP, and reinvested
    dividends thereon, the number of shares of restricted stock and the market
    value of such shares at December 31, 2001 held for Messrs. Nye, Biegler,
    Gibbs, Dickie and McNally were 256,714 ($12,104,065), 27,702 ($1,306,149),
    43,640 ($2,057,626), 40,142 ($1,892,695) and 57,501 ($2,711,172),
    respectively.

    As noted, salaries deferred under the DICP are included in amounts reported
    as Salary in the Summary Compensation Table. Amounts shown in the table
    below represent the number of shares purchased under the DICP with these
    deferred salaries for 2001 and the number of shares awarded under the LTICP:

(5) Amounts reported as All Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation
    Table are attributable to the named officer's participation in certain
    plans and as otherwise described in this footnote.

    Under the TXU Thrift Plan (Thrift Plan) all eligible employees of the
    Company and any of its participating subsidiaries may invest up to 16% of
    their regular salary or wages in common stock of the Company, or in a
    variety of selected mutual funds. Under the Thrift Plan, the Company
    matches a portion of an employee's contributions. For plan years beginning
    prior to January 1, 2002, the Company matching contribution was an amount
    equal to 40%, 50% or 60% (depending on the employee's length of service) of
    the first 6% of such employee's contributions. Beginning January 1, 2002,
    the Thrift Plan was amended to increase the Company matching contribution
    to 75% (regardless of the employee's length of service) of the first 6% of
    the employee's contribution

                                      10

<PAGE>

    for employees covered under the traditional defined benefit component of
    the TXU Retirement Plan, and 100% (regardless of the employee's length of
    service) of the first 6% of the employee's contribution for employees
    covered under the cash balance component of the TXU Retirement Plan. All
    matching contributions are invested in common stock of the Company. The
    amounts reported under All Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation
    Table include these matching amounts which, for Messrs. Nye, Biegler,
    Gibbs, Dickie and McNally were $6,120, $6,120, $5,100, $3,696 and $4,080,
    respectively, during 2001.

    Under the SDP each employee of the Company and its participating
    subsidiaries whose annual salary is equal to or greater than an amount
    established under the SDP ($103,960 for the program year beginning April 1,
    2001) may elect to defer up to 50% of annual base salary, and/or up to 100%
    of any bonus or incentive award, for a period of seven years, for a period
    ending with the retirement of such employee, or for a combination thereof.
    Beginning in 2002, participants may also elect to defer amounts that would
    otherwise mature under the DICP, under and subject to the provisions of the
    SDP, provided that any such deferral election must be made at least 12
    months prior to the date that the amount would otherwise mature under the
    DICP. The Company makes a matching award, subject to forfeiture under
    certain circumstances, equal to 100% of up to the first 8% of salary
    deferred under the SDP; provided that employees who first become eligible
    to participate in the SDP on or after January 1, 2002, who are also
    eligible, or become eligible, to participate in the DICP, are not eligible
    to receive such SDP matching award. Salary and bonuses deferred under the
    SDP are included in amounts reported under Salary and Bonus, respectively,
    in the Summary Compensation Table. Deferrals are credited with earnings or
    losses based on the performance of investment alternatives under the SDP
    selected by each participant. At the end of the applicable maturity period,
    the trustee for the SDP distributes the deferrals and the applicable
    earnings in cash. The distribution is in a lump sum if the applicable
    maturity period is seven years. If the retirement option is elected, for
    distributions beginning prior to 2002, the distribution is in twenty annual
    installments, and for distributions beginning in 2002 and thereafter, the
    distribution is made in a number of annual installments selected in advance
    by the participant from 1 to 10 years or 15 years or 20 years. The Company
    is financing the retirement option portion of the SDP through the purchase
    of corporate-owned life insurance on the lives of participants. The
    proceeds from such insurance are expected to allow the Company to fully
    recover the cost of the retirement option. During 2001, matching awards,
    which are included under All Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation
    Table, were made for Messrs. Nye, Biegler, Gibbs, Dickie and McNally in the
    amounts of $77,167, $52,000, $45,400, $65,867 and $41,867, respectively.

    Under the TXU Split-Dollar Life Insurance Program (Insurance Program),
    split-dollar life insurance policies are purchased for elected corporate
    officers of the Company and its participating subsidiaries with a title of
    Vice President or above, with a death benefit equal to four times their
    annual Insurance Program compensation. The Insurance Program was amended,
    effective January 1, 2002, such that eligibility for the Insurance Program
    will be further limited and the death benefit of participants' insurance
    policies will be equal to two, three or four times their annual Insurance
    Program compensation depending on the officer category of the participant
    and the date the participant first became eligible for the Insurance
    Program. New participants vest in the policies issued under the Insurance
    Program over a six-year period. The Company pays the premiums for the
    policies and has received a collateral assignment of the policies equal in
    value to the sum of all of its insurance premium payments. Although the
    Insurance Program is terminable at any time, it is designed so that if it
    is continued, the Company will fully recover all of the insurance premium
    payments it has made either upon the death of the participant or, if the
    assumptions made as to policy yield are realized, upon the later of 15
    years of participation or the participant's attainment of age 65. During
    2001, the economic benefit derived by Messrs. Nye, Biegler, Gibbs, Dickie
    and McNally from the term insurance coverage provided and the interest
    foregone on the remainder of the insurance premiums paid by the Company
    amounted to $139,371, $39,286, $66,286, $13,666 and $16,900, respectively.

   As a part of the acquisition of ENSERCH Corporation (now known as TXU Gas
Company) in 1997, options to purchase the common stock of ENSERCH which had
been granted to various employees of ENSERCH were converted into options to
acquire common shares of the Company. The table below shows, for each of the
named officers, the information specified with respect to exercised,
exercisable and unexercisable options under all existing stock option plans,
converted into shares of the Company's common stock into which such options
became exercisable at the time of the ENSERCH acquisition.

   The Company and its subsidiaries maintain retirement plans (TXU Retirement
Plan) which are qualified under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (Code). Annual retirement benefits under the
traditional defined benefit component of the TXU Retirement Plan, which applied
to each of the named officers during 2001, are computed as follows: for each
year of accredited service up to a total of 40 years, 1.3% of the first $7,800,
plus 1.5% of the excess over $7,800, of the participant's average annual
earnings during his or her three years of highest earnings. During 2001,
employees, other than employees subject to collective bargaining requirements,
who were participating under the traditional defined benefit component of the
TXU Retirement Plan were given a one-time irrevocable election to continue
their participation under such traditional defined benefit component, or to
convert to a new cash balance component effective January 1, 2002. Under this
new cash balance component, hypothetical accounts, which reflect the
participant's benefit under

                                      13

<PAGE>

the plan, are established for participants. Participants' accounts are credited
with monthly contribution credits equal to a percentage of the participant's
compensation (3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5% or 6.5%, depending on the participant's combined
age and years of service), and interest credits based upon the average yield of
the 30-year Treasury bond rate for the 12 months ending November 30 of the
prior year. As of January 1, 2002, the benefit of employees who chose to
convert to the new cash balance component was the actuarial equivalent of their
accrued benefit under the traditional defined benefit component. All employees
who begin their participation in the TXU Retirement Plan on or after January 1,
2002, will participate under this cash balance component. Amounts reported
under Salary for the named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table
approximate earnings as defined under the traditional defined benefit component
of the TXU Retirement Plan without regard to any limitations imposed by the
Code. Benefits paid under the traditional defined benefit component of the TXU
Retirement Plan are not subject to any reduction for Social Security payments
but are limited by provisions of the Code. As of December 31, 2001, years of
accredited service under the TXU Retirement Plan for Messrs. Nye, Biegler,
Gibbs, Dickie and McNally were 39, 4, 39, 2 and 5, respectively.

   Before the ENSERCH acquisition, Mr. Biegler earned retirement benefits under
the Retirement and Death Benefit Program of 1969 of ENSERCH Corporation and
Participating Subsidiary Companies (ENSERCH Retirement Plan) which was merged
into, and became a part of, the TXU Retirement Plan effective December 31,
1997. In connection with this plan merger, the TXU Retirement Plan was amended
to provide that the retirement benefit of certain ENSERCH employees will equal
the sum of (1) their accrued benefit under the ENSERCH Retirement Plan through
the last pay period of 1997 and (2) their accrued benefit under the TXU
Retirement Plan beginning with the first pay period of 1998; provided that the
aggregate retirement benefit earned under the traditional defined benefit
component of the plans can be no less than the retirement benefit which would
have been earned had all service under the traditional defined benefit
component been under the ENSERCH Retirement Plan. Mr. Biegler, whose employment
with the Company began August 5, 1997, is treated in a similar manner. Amounts
reported for Mr. Biegler under Salary and Bonus in the Summary Compensation
Table approximate earnings as defined by the ENSERCH Retirement Plan without
regard to any limitations imposed by the Code. Benefits paid under the ENSERCH
Retirement Plan are not subject to any reduction for Social Security payments
but are limited by provisions of the Code. As of Mr. Biegler's retirement date
of December 31, 2001, he had 29 years of accredited service under the ENSERCH

the TXU Retirement Plan.

   The Company's supplemental retirement plans (Supplemental Plan) provide for
the payment of retirement benefits which would otherwise be limited by the Code
or the definition of earnings in the TXU Retirement Plan or the ENSERCH
Retirement Plan, as applicable. Under the Supplemental Plan, retirement
benefits are calculated in accordance with the same formula used under the
applicable qualified plan, except that, with respect to calculating the portion
of the Supplemental Plan benefit attributable to service under the defined
benefit component of the TXU Retirement Plan, earnings also include AIP awards
(50% of the AIP award is reported under Bonus for the named officers in the
Summary Compensation Table). The tables set forth above illustrate the total
annual benefit payable at retirement under the TXU Retirement Plan and the
ENSERCH Retirement Plan, respectively, inclusive of benefits payable under the
Supplemental Plan, prior to any reduction for earlier-than-normal or a
contingent beneficiary option which may be selected by participants.

                ORGANIZATION AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
                           ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

   The Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
(Committee) is responsible for reviewing and establishing the compensation of
the executive officers of the Company. The Committee consists of all of the
directors of the Company who are not employees or former employees of the
Company and is chaired by J. E. Oesterreicher. The Committee has directed the
preparation of this report and has approved its content and submission to the
shareholders.

   As a matter of policy, the Committee believes that levels of executive
compensation should be based upon an evaluation of the performance of the
Company and its officers generally, as well as in comparison to persons with
comparable responsibilities in similar business enterprises. Compensation plans
should align executive compensation with returns to shareholders with due
consideration accorded to balancing both long-term and short-term objectives.
The overall compensation program should provide for an appropriate and
competitive balance between base salaries and performance-based annual and
long-term incentives. The Committee has determined that, as a matter of policy
to be implemented over time, the base salaries of the officers will be
established around the median, or 50th percentile, of the base salaries
provided by other large energy companies, or other relevant market, and that
opportunities for total direct compensation (defined as the sum of base
salaries, annual incentives and long-term incentives) to reach the 75th
percentile, or above, of such market or markets will be provided through annual
and long-term performance-based incentive compensation plans. Such compensation
principles and practices have allowed, and should continue to allow, the
Company to attract, retain and motivate its key executives.

   In furtherance of these policies, nationally recognized compensation
consultants have been retained to assist the Committee in its periodic reviews
of compensation and benefits provided to officers. The consultants' evaluations
include comparisons to the largest utilities and energy companies as well as to
general industry with respect both to the level and composition of officers'
compensation.

   The compensation of the officers of the Company consists principally of base
salaries, the opportunity to earn an incentive award under the Annual Incentive
Plan (AIP), awards of performance-based restricted shares under the Long-Term
Incentive Compensation Plan (Long-Term Plan) and the opportunity to participate
in the Deferred and Incentive Compensation Plan (DICP). Awards under the AIP
are directly related to annual performances as evaluated by the Committee. The
ultimate value of any awards of performance-based restricted shares under the
Long-Term Plan, as well as the value of future payments under the DICP are
directly related to the future performance of the Company's common stock. It is
anticipated that performance-based incentive awards under the AIP and the
Long-Term Plan, will, in future years, continue to constitute a substantial
percentage of the officers' total compensation.

   During 2001, a comprehensive review of compensation and benefits provided to
officers and other employees was completed. The purpose of the review which was
conducted with the assistance of independent compensation and benefit
consultants, was to assure that the Company's compensation and benefit plans
continue to be appropriately competitive in the markets in which the Company
and its

                                      16

<PAGE>

subsidiaries operate. Recommendations arising from the review were considered
by the Committee and the Board of Directors, and generally are being
implemented. Changes in benefits related principally to employees in the United
States and included adoption of a cash balance retirement formula, increases in
the Company match under the employee savings plan, implementation of flexible
health and welfare benefits and limitations on the Company's contributions
towards the cost of post-retirement medical benefits for persons who retire in
the future. Changes in officers' compensation plans are more fully described
elsewhere in this report and proxy statement, and generally are intended to
facilitate the inclusion of Company and subsidiary officers in a common
framework of annual and long-term incentive opportunities.

   The AIP, which was first approved by the shareholders in 1995 and reapproved
in 2000, is administered by the Committee and provides an objective framework
within which annual performance can be evaluated by the Committee. Depending on
the results of such performance evaluations, and the attainment of the per
share net income goals established in advance, the Committee may provide annual
incentive compensation awards to eligible officers. In 2001 the evaluation of
each individual participant's performance was based on the attainment of
individual and business unit objectives. As amended in 2001 with respect to
awards that may be provided in 2002 and thereafter, the evaluation of each
individual participant's performance may be based upon the attainment of a
combination of corporate, group, business unit, function and/or individual
objectives. The Company's annual performance is evaluated based upon its total
return to shareholders, return on invested capital and earnings growth, as well
as other measures including competitiveness, service quality and employee
safety. The combination of individual and Company results, together with the
Committee's evaluation of the competitive level of compensation which is
appropriate for such results, determines the amount, if any, actually awarded.
The AIP was also amended in 2001 to provide for the participation of certain
officers of subsidiaries and to provide for the payment of awards in cash
thereby eliminating the requirement that the receipt of 50% of such awards be
deferred.

   The Long-Term Plan, which was first approved by the shareholders in 1997 is
also administered by the Committee and is a comprehensive stock-based incentive
compensation plan under which all awards are made in, or based on the value of,
the Company's common stock. The Long-Term Plan provides that, in the discretion
of the Committee, awards may be in the form of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, performance and/or restricted stock or stock units or in
any other stock-based form. The purpose of the Long-Term Plan is to provide
performance-related incentives linked to long-term performance goals. Such
performance goals may be based on individual performance and/or may include
criteria such as absolute or relative levels of total shareholder return,
revenues, sales, net income or net worth of the Company, any of its
subsidiaries, business units or other areas, all as the Committee may
determine. Awards under the Long-Term Plan provided to the officers of the
Company have all been in the form of performance based restricted stock as more
fully described hereinafter. Awards under the Long-Term Plan constitute the
principal long-term component of officers' compensation.

   As required by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the
deductibility of compensation, the Long-Term Plan, as amended to increase the
maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued pursuant to awards under
the Plan, is being submitted for reapproval by the shareholders. Detailed
information concerning this proposal is contained on pages 23 through 26 of
this proxy statement. The reapproval is being requested so as to comply with
the Internal Revenue Code and to increase the number of shares that may be
awarded under the plan. The Committee believes that the Long-Term Plan is an
important and appropriate component of officers' compensation and recommends
that the shareholders vote in favor of reapproval.

   In establishing levels of executive compensation at its May 2001 meeting,
the Committee reviewed various performance and compensation data, including the
performance measures under the AIP and

                                      17

<PAGE>

the report of its compensation consultant. Information was also gathered from
industry sources and other published and private materials which provided a
basis for comparing the largest electric and gas utilities and other survey
groups representing a large variety of business organizations. Included in the
data considered were the comparative returns provided by the largest electric
and gas utilities as represented by the returns of the Standard & Poor's
Electric Utility Index which are reflected in the graph on page 20.
Compensation amounts were established by the Committee based upon its
consideration of the above comparative data and its subjective evaluation of
Company and individual performance at levels consistent with the Committee's
policy relating to total direct compensation.

   At its meeting in May 2001, the Committee provided awards of
performance-based restricted shares under the Long-Term Plan to certain
officers, including the Chief Executive. Information relating to awards made to
the named executive officers is contained in the Table on page 10 of this proxy
statement. The ultimate value of those awards, if any, will be determined by
the Company's total return to shareholders over a three year period compared to
the total return for that period of the companies comprising the Standard &
Poor's Electric Utility Index. Depending upon the Company's relative total
return for such period, the officers may earn from 0% to 200% of the original
award, and their compensation is, thereby, directly related to shareholder
value. Awards granted in May 2001 contemplate that 200% of the original award
will be provided if the Company's total return is in the 81st percentile or
above of the returns of the companies comprising the Standard & Poor's Electric
Utility Index and that such percentage of the original award will be reduced as
the Company's return compared to the returns provided by the companies in the
Index declines so that 0% of the original award will be provided if the
Company's return is in the 40th percentile or below of returns provided by the
companies comprising the Index. These awards, and any awards that may be made
in the future, are based upon the Committee's evaluation of the appropriate
level of long-term compensation consistent with its policy relating to total
direct compensation.

   Additionally, with respect to the Long-Term Plan, the Committee, at its
meeting in May 2001, considered the performance-based restricted stock awards
provided to certain officers in May of 1998. Based upon its review and
comparison of the Company's total return to the returns provided by the
companies comprising the Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index, the
Committee determined that the Company's performance during the three year
performance period ending in March of 2001 permitted the payment of 50% of such
1998 awards. Payments of these awards were made in the form of the Company's
stock and cash, and, for Messrs. Nye, Biegler, Gibbs and McNally, the value of
the stock at the date of distribution is included in the LTIP Payouts column of
the Summary Compensation Table on page 8 of this proxy statement.

   Certain of the Company's business units have developed separate annual and
long-term incentive compensation plans. Those plans focus on the results
achieved by those individual business units and the compensation opportunities
provided by those plans are considered to be competitive in the markets in
which those units compete. Generally, officers may not participate in both the
traditional incentive compensation plans as discussed herein and the business
unit plans. None of the named officers participate in the individual business
unit plans.

   As previously reported, the Committee recommended, and the Board
subsequently approved, employment contracts with certain officers including the
Chief Executive. Such agreements with Messrs. Nye, Dickie and McNally, as well
as the agreement entered into with Mr. Gibbs in June 2001, are described in
footnote 6 on pages 12 and 13 of the proxy statement.

   In May 2001 the Committee increased Mr. Nye's base salary as Chief Executive
to an annual rate of $975,000 representing a $25,000 or 2.6% increase over the
amount established for Mr. Nye in May of 2000. Based upon the Committee's
evaluation of individual and Company performance, as called for by the AIP, the
Committee provided Mr. Nye with an AIP award of $950,000 compared to the prior

                                      18

<PAGE>

year's award of $760,000. The Committee also awarded 125,000 shares of
performance-based restricted stock to Mr. Nye. Under the terms of the award,
Mr. Nye can earn from 0% to 200% of the award, depending on the Company's total
return to shareholders over a three-year period (April 1, 2001 through March
31, 2004) compared to the total return provided by the companies comprising the
Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index. This level of compensation was
established based upon the Committee's subjective evaluation of the information
described in this report. In addition, as previously noted in this report, the
Committee approved the payment of 50% of the 1998 performance-based restricted
stock awards under the Long-Term Plan, which for Mr. Nye was 11,000 shares.

   In discharging its responsibilities with respect to establishing officers'
compensation, the Committee has normally considered such matters at its May
meetings including its May 2001 meeting. Beginning in 2002, the Committee is
expected to consider officers' compensation matters at its February meetings
and to report to the shareholders on these matters in the following years'
proxy statement. Although Company management may be present during Committee
discussions of officers' compensation, Committee decisions with respect to the
compensation of the Chief Executive are reached in private session without the
presence of any member of Company management.

   Section 162(m) of the Code limits the deductibility of compensation which a
publicly traded corporation provides to its most highly compensated officers.
As a general policy, the Company does not intend to provide compensation which
is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Awards under the AIP in 1996
and subsequent years have been, and are expected to continue to be, fully
deductible. Awards under the Long-Term Plan are expected to be fully
deductible, and the DICP and the Salary Deferral Program have been amended to
require the deferral of distributions of amounts maturing in years subsequent
to 1995 until the time when such amounts would be deductible.

   Shareholder comments to the Committee are welcomed and should be addressed
to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's offices.

                            AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Committee) assists the Board
in providing oversight of the Company's auditing, accounting and financial
reporting processes, and the Company's system of internal control. The role and
responsibilities of the Committee are fully set forth in the Committee's
written charter which was approved by the Board of Directors and which is
reproduced in Appendix B to this proxy statement. The Committee consists solely
of independent directors as defined by the listing standards of the New York
Stock Exchange and is chaired by William M. Griffin. This Committee has
directed the preparation of this report and has approved its content and
submission to the shareholders.

   The Committee has received the written disclosures and letter from Deloitte
& Touche LLP, the independent auditors for the Company, as required by
Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with
Audit Committee), and has discussed with Deloitte & Touche its independence.
The Committee has received reports from Deloitte & Touche and Company
management relating to services provided by the auditors and associated fees.
In this regard the Committee has considered whether or not the provision of
non-audit services by Deloitte & Touche for the year 2001 is compatible with
maintaining the independence of the firm. In furtherance of the objective of
assuring the auditors' independence, the Committee has adopted a policy
relating to the engagement of the Company's independent auditors as described
on page 27 of this proxy statement.

   The Committee reviewed and discussed with Company management and Deloitte &
Touche the interim unaudited financial statements and the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2001. The
Committee also discussed with Deloitte & Touche those matters required to be
discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication with Audit
Committees) concerning the quality of the Company's accounting principles as
applied in its financial statements.

   Based on its review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board
of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001.
Additionally, as noted hereinafter in this proxy statement, the Committee
recommended to the Board of Directors that Deloitte & Touche be selected to act
as independent auditors for 2002, subject to shareholder approval.

   Shareholder comments to the Committee are welcomed and should be addressed
to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's offices.

                AMENDMENT TO RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
                     FOR AUTHORITY TO EFFECT A STOCK SPLIT

   The Board of Directors has unanimously approved, subject to shareholder
approval, an amendment of the Restated Articles of Incorporation that would
split the common stock of the Company, effective at such time, if any, on or
before December 31, 2003 as the Board of Directors may determine, by changing
each issued share into no more than two shares. The full text of the proposed
amendment is set forth in Appendix A attached to this proxy statement.

   The Board of Directors anticipates that the stock split, if effected, will
cause the market price for the common stock to be reduced so that it is in a
range more attractive to investors, particularly individuals, and may result in
a broader market for the shares.

   If the stock split is effected, each shareholder of record at the record
date determined by the Board of the Directors for the stock split would
automatically become the holder of, and be entitled to receive a certificate or
certificates for, additional shares of common stock for shares of common stock
owned of record by such shareholder. If the stock split is effected in a manner
that would create fractional shares, shareholders will be entitled to receive
cash in lieu of any such fractional shares in an amount determined by, or in
accordance with procedures established by, the Board of Directors.

   The Board of Directors will be authorized by the stock split amendment to
determine an effective date for the stock split at any time on or before
December 31, 2003, or they may determine not to effect the stock split if they
determine that the proposed stock split is not in the best interest of the
Company. A similar amendment was approved by shareholders in May 1999 but
expired in December 2000 without being implemented by the Board of Directors.

   The Company has been advised by tax counsel that the proposed stock split
would not result in any gain or loss or realization of taxable income to owners
of common stock under existing U.S. federal income tax law except for the
receipt of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares. The cost basis for tax
purposes of each new share and each retained share would be equal to a fraction
of the cost basis for tax purposes of the retained share immediately prior to
the stock split. In addition, the holding period for the additional shares
issued pursuant to the stock split would be deemed to be the same as the
holding period for the retained shares of common stock. The laws of
jurisdictions other than the United States may impose income taxes on the
issuance of the additional shares and shareholders are advised to consult their
tax advisors.

 The Board of Directors Recommends a Vote FOR the Approval of this Amendment.

                               REAPPROVAL OF THE
               LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN, AS AMENDED

   As indicated in the Organization and Compensation Committee Report, the
Company's compensation philosophy is based on pay for performance. Consistent
with this philosophy, in 1997, the Board recommended, and the shareholders
approved, a Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (Long-Term Plan or Plan). The
purpose of the Long-Term Plan is to assist the Company in attracting, retaining
and motivating executive officers and other key employees essential to the
success of the Company through performance-related incentives linked to
long-range performance goals. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
provides that, in order for the Company to continue to deduct fully for federal
income tax purposes compensation paid under the Long-Term Plan to its five most
highly compensated officers, the Company must seek reapproval of the Long-Term
Plan every five years. Accordingly, reapproval of the Long-Term Plan, as
amended to increase the maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to
Awards under the Plan, is being sought in order to comply with this legal
requirement. The Board of Directors believes that the Long-Term Plan is an
effective tool in maintaining an appropriate and competitive compensation
program, and recommends the reapproval of the Plan, as amended.

   The Long-Term Plan is a comprehensive stock-based incentive compensation
plan under which all awards (Awards) are made in, or based on the value of, the
Company's common stock. Awards may be in the form of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, performance and/or restricted stock or stock units or in
any other stock-based form. As noted above, the Long-Term Plan provides
performance-related incentives linked to long-term performance goals. Such
performance goals applicable to Awards under the Plan may be based on
individual performance and/or may include criteria such as absolute or relative
levels of total shareholder return, revenues, sales, net income or net worth of
the Company, any of its subsidiaries, business units or other areas, all as the
Organization and Compensation Committee may determine.

   The Long-Term Plan is administered by the Organization and Compensation
Committee (Committee) which consists entirely of directors who are neither
current nor former employees of the Company. Employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries who are designated by the Committee as key employees are eligible
to participate in, and receive Awards under, the Plan. The selection of key
employees who are to receive Awards under the Plan, as well as all terms,
conditions, performance criteria and restrictions applicable to each Award, are
determined by the Committee in its discretion. The Committee may delegate to
the Company's Chief Executive the authority to grant Awards to key employees
who are not executive officers.

   Awards under the Long-Term Plan constitute the principal long-term component
of officers' compensation. As of December 31, 2001, Awards had been provided to
161 persons including the Company's executive officers. All Awards provided to
date to executive officers have been in the form of performance-based
restricted stock. Under each of these Awards, the Company's total return to
shareholders is compared to the total return of companies comprising the
Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index over a three-year performance period.
Depending upon the Company's total return for such period compared to the
returns provided by the companies comprising the Standard & Poor's Electric
Utility Index, the awardees may earn from 0% to 200% of the original award and
their compensation is thereby directly related to shareholder returns.

   The maximum number of shares of common stock for which Awards may be granted
under the Long-Term Plan, as approved by shareholders in 1997, is 2,500,000
subject to adjustment in the event of a merger, consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, or other similar event. Shares
subject to previously canceled, lapsed or forfeited Awards or Awards paid in
cash may be reissued under the Long-Term Plan. Shares issued under the
Long-Term Plan may consist of

                                      23

<PAGE>

authorized but unissued shares, shares issued and reacquired by the Company or
shares purchased in the open market. As of March 11, 2002, the closing price of
a share of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $52.03. During the
last five years, performance-based restricted stock awards under the Long-Term
Plan have constituted a substantial and increasing percentage of officers'
total compensation. It is expected that this trend will continue in the future.
Assuming the maximum payout of the outstanding awards as of December 31, 2001,
approximately 188,000 shares of common stock are available for the granting of
awards under the Long-Term Plan. Accordingly, shareholder approval is being
sought to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock available under
the Long-Term Plan by 7,500,000 shares, such shares to be utilized for the
granting of awards over the next five years until the termination of the Plan.
The Board of Directors believes that such increase is necessary and desirable
for the Company to continue to attract, motivate and retain the talent
necessary for the Company's success and to continue to align a significant
portion of officers' compensation with the future performance of the Company's
common stock.

   Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Long-Term Plan provides
for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock and stock
appreciation rights (SARS); however, to date no such awards have been made. The
number of shares and other terms of any such grant will be determined by the
Committee. The price payable upon exercise of an option may not be less than
100% of the fair market value of the common stock at the time of the grant, and
may be paid in cash or with shares of common stock. Under the terms of the
Plan, options may not be exercised until at least six months after they are
granted, except in the case of the death or disability of the participant or a
change in control of the Company. Options may remain outstanding for no more
than ten years. SARs entitle the participant to receive, upon exercise of the
SAR, cash or, at the election of the Committee, shares of common stock or a
combination thereof, in an amount equal to the difference between the SAR
exercise price and the fair market value of the shares of common stock subject
to the SAR. SARs may be granted to participants under the Long-Term Plan on a
freestanding basis or in tandem with a stock option. The exercise price of SARs
will be not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant. SARs granted under the Long-Term Plan will not be exercisable
until at least six months following the date of grant and no later than ten
years thereafter. Incentive stock options and SARs may not be transferred other
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

   Stock and Stock Unit Awards.  The Long-Term Plan also provides for the
granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and
performance units, bonus stock and other stock-based Awards. To date, all
Awards to the Company's executive officers have been in the form of
performance-based restricted stock. The number of shares or units and all terms
and conditions, including the restriction period, performance criteria and
other restrictions and conditions applicable to each such Award, are determined
by the Committee. During the restriction period, participants may exercise full
voting rights, and will be entitled to receive all dividends and other
distributions paid, with respect to restricted stock they have been granted;
provided that stock dividends, if any, remain subject to the same restrictions
as the underlying stock. Payment to the participant may be in shares of common
stock or cash, or a combination thereof, and in a lump sum or installments, all
as determined by the Committee. Shares of common stock may also be awarded to
participants under the Long-Term Plan as a bonus. Such shares may be granted
with or without restrictions. Shares awarded subject to performance criteria or
other restrictions which are not satisfied, are forfeited and must be returned
to the Company. In addition to the foregoing types of Awards, the Long-Term
Plan permits the Committee to grant any other stock-based award as the
Committee may determine. Such stock-based Awards may be in the form of the
Company's common stock or other securities, the value of which is based, in
whole or in part, on the value of the Company's common stock on the grant date.

   In the event of a change-in-control of the Company, all outstanding stock
options and SARs shall immediately become fully vested, and the forfeiture
provisions otherwise applicable to all other

                                      24

<PAGE>

outstanding Awards shall no longer apply, except with respect to any then
existing forfeiture provisions applicable in the event of the termination of a
participant for cause or a participant's voluntary resignation. Under the terms
of the Long-Term Plan, a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if:
(i) any person becomes the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Company's
voting securities; or (ii) the individuals who constitute the current board of
directors of the Company cease to constitute at least a majority thereof,
provided that individuals who are nominated by at least 75% of the incumbent
board shall be considered members of the incumbent board; or (iii) a
recapitalization occurs which results in either a decrease of at least 33% of
the aggregate percentage ownership of the Company's voting securities held by
independent shareholders, or an increase in the aggregate percentage of the
Company's voting securities held by non-independent shareholders to more than
50%; or (iv) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are
liquidated or transferred to an unrelated party; or (v) the Company is a party
to a merger, consolidation, reorganization or other business combination
transaction pursuant to which the Company is not the surviving ultimate parent
entity; or (vi) the Company is a party to merger, consolidation, reorganization
or other business combination transaction which requires the approval of the
shareholders of the Company and which results in an increase of 20% or more in
the number of the Company's voting securities outstanding.

   Assuming that shareholder reapproval is obtained, the Company expects that
Awards paid under the Long-Term Plan will continue to be fully deductible for
federal income tax purposes. Among other requirements, Section 162(m) of the
Code, which limits such deductions, requires that a maximum amount of
performance-based compensation which can be provided to any covered participant
be established; and, for this purpose, such annual aggregate maximum amount
that may be paid to a covered participant during any calendar year is 100,000
shares with respect to stock options and SARs and, with respect to other
Awards, is the fair market value of 100,000 shares as of the first day of such
year. Because all Awards are within the discretion of the Committee, the Awards
that will be made in the future, as well as the number of employees to whom
Awards may be made, are not presently determinable. As noted above, executive
officers and other designated key employees are eligible to receive awards
under the Long-Term Plan.

   The Long-Term Plan may be amended, modified, suspended or terminated by the
Board of Directors at any time. No amendment shall be effective prior to
approval of the shareholders to the extent such approval is necessary to
satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code or to comply with any
other legal requirement. If not earlier terminated, the Long-Term Plan shall
terminate on December 31, 2006.

   Federal Income Tax Consequences.  Options granted under the Long-Term Plan
will have the following federal income tax consequences under the present
provisions of the Code. The Company's deductions for compensation paid under
the Long-Term Plan are in all cases subject to the requirement of
reasonableness.

   Incentive Stock Options.  Neither the grant, exercise nor purchase of shares
under an incentive stock option will cause the recognition of ordinary income
by the participant provided the participant does not dispose of the underlying
shares within two years from the date of the grant of the option and within one
year after the exercise of the option. However, the amount by which the fair
market value of the shares at the time of exercise exceeds the exercise price
will be treated as an item includable in the tax base upon which "alternative
minimum tax" may be imposed. Neither the grant nor the exercise of an incentive
stock option will produce a tax deduction for the Company.

   If the shares purchased by the participant pursuant to the exercise of an
incentive stock option are disposed of after the expiration of two years from
the date of the grant of the option and after one year from the date of
exercise, the gain or loss on the sale, based upon the difference between the
amount realized and the exercise price, will constitute long-term capital gain
or loss. If the shares purchased by

                                      25

<PAGE>

a participant pursuant to the exercise of an incentive stock option are sold at
a gain prior to the expiration of either of such periods, so much of the gain
as does not exceed the difference between the exercise price and the lesser of
the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise or the amount
realized on the date of sale will be taxable as compensation to the
participant; and a tax deduction will be allowable to the Company in an amount
equal to the compensation recognized by the participant.

   Nonqualified Options.  The grant of a nonqualified option will not cause the
recognition of ordinary income by the participant or entitle the Company to a
deduction for federal income tax purposes because, under existing Treasury
regulations, such an option does not have a "readily ascertainable" fair market
value. The exercise of a nonqualified option which is not subject to any
restrictions on the participant's ownership or disposition thereof will cause
the recognition of compensation in an amount equal to the difference between
the exercise price and the fair market value on the exercise date of the shares
purchased by the participant, and a tax deduction will be available to the
Company in an amount equal to the compensation recognized by the participant.
If restrictions apply regarding forfeiture and transferability to the shares
upon exercise, the time of recognition of compensation and the amount thereof,
and the availability of a tax deduction to the Company, will be determined when
such restrictions cease to apply.

   Board of Directors Recommendation.  The Board of Directors believes that the
reapproval of the Long-Term Plan, as amended to increase the number of shares
available under the Plan, will advance the interests of the Company and its
shareholders by enabling the Company to continue to attract, retain and
motivate high caliber, executive officers and other key employees by offering
compensation incentives which are directly linked to returns to shareholders.

        The Board of Directors Recommends a Vote FOR Reapproval of the
              Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, as Amended.

                             SELECTION OF AUDITORS

   The Audit Committee has nominated to the Board of Directors for its
consideration the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP to act as independent auditors
for the Company for the year 2002 and, subject to the approval of shareholders
at the annual meeting, the Board has selected that firm to audit the books of
account and records of the Company and to make a report thereon to the
shareholders. The persons named in the proxy will, unless otherwise instructed
thereon, vote your shares in favor of the following resolution which will be
submitted for consideration:

      RESOLVED that the selection of the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP,
   independent auditors, to audit the books of account and records of the
   Company for the year 2002, to make a report thereon, and to perform other
   services, be, and it hereby is, approved.

   The firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, has been the
outside auditors for the Company since its organization in 1996 and for TXU
Energy Industries Company (formerly Texas Utilities Company) since its
organization in 1945, including the last fiscal year.

   The Audit Committee has adopted a policy relating to the engagement of the
Company's independent auditors. The policy, which was adopted in February 2002,
provides that, in addition to the audit of the financial statements and related
quarterly reviews, the firm will be engaged to provide: (i) auditing or
accounting services relating to matters where the firm's opinion, consent or
certification is separately required; (ii) analyses and interpretive advice
relating to accounting policies and their application; (iii) due diligence
reviews relating principally to considerations of counterparties' accounting
policies and practices and/or accounting for certain related transactions; and
(iv) services with respect to tax matters. In addition to the enumerated
services, the policy also provides that, within certain limits and with the
approval of the Committee, the firm may be engaged to provide other services.
Engagements of the firm relating to due diligence reviews and tax and other
services that are expected to exceed established monetary levels will require
prior approval of the Committee. The policy provides further that the Company's
independent auditors will not be engaged to provide management advisory
services related to business strategy, valuations and the like, services
related to the design and/or implementation of financial information systems or
internal audit services.

   The Committee's policy relating to the engagement of Deloitte & Touche will
be administered by the Company's chief internal audit executive. The Committee
and/or chief internal audit executive, as appropriate, will review and approve
the services to be provided by the firm and related fees. Reports from Deloitte
& Touche and the chief internal audit executive describing the services
provided by the firm and the fees for such services will be provided to the
Committee on a semi-annual basis.

   During the year ended December 31, 2001 fees billed to the Company by
Deloitte & Touche were as follows:

      Audit Fees.  Fees billed for professional services rendered in connection
   with the audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and
   reviews of the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's
   Forms 10-Q were $4,046,000.

      Financial Information System Design and Implementation Fees.  Deloitte &
   Touche was not engaged to provide any services relating to the design and/or
   implementation of financial information systems during 2001.

      All Other Fees.  Deloitte & Touche's fees for all other professional
   services rendered to the Company during 2001 totaled $8,336,000 including,
   as described below, audit related and tax fees of $6,631,000 and other fees
   of $1,705,000.

                                      27

<PAGE>

   As noted, audit related and tax fees billed by Deloitte & Touche during 2001
totaled $6,631,000 including amounts billed in connection with: (i) audits
required by certain statutes, principally in the United Kingdom ($634,000);
other audits and certifications, principally employee benefit plan audits
($394,000); and services relating to registration statements and other
financing documents ($896,000); (ii) analyses and interpretive advice relating
to accounting policies and their application ($1,073,000); (iii) auditing or
accounting services in connection with due diligence reviews ($2,612,000); and
(iv) services with respect to tax matters ($1,022,000). Fees for other services
totaled $1,705,000 including amounts billed in connection with rate case
proceedings ($385,000), services relating to process improvements, reviews and
assurances ($586,000), expatriate tax services ($328,000), and other matters,
principally management advisory services ($406,000).

   Representatives of Deloitte & Touche are expected to be present at the
annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they
desire to do so, and to respond to appropriate questions.

    The Board of Directors Recommends a Vote FOR the Approval of Auditors.

                                OTHER BUSINESS

   Other than as stated herein, the Board of Directors does not intend to bring
any business before the meeting and it has not been informed of any matters
that may be presented to the meeting by others. However, if any other matters
properly come before the meeting, it is the intent of the Board of Directors
that the persons named in the proxy will vote pursuant to the proxy in
accordance with their judgment in such matters.

Dated: March 26, 2002


            Whether or not you will be able to attend the meeting,
            please sign and return the accompanying proxy promptly.

                                  APPENDIX A

                AMENDMENT TO RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

      RESOLVED that Article VI of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the
   Company be, and hereby is, amended by adding the following paragraph,
   effective as of such time on or before December 31, 2003, if any, as the
   Board of Directors may determine:

       "Each share of common stock of the corporation issued and outstanding or
       held in the treasury of the corporation immediately prior to the close
       of business on [the date established for the stock split by the Board of
       Directors] is changed into and reclassified as [a number, not to exceed
       two, to be established by the Board of Directors] fully paid and
       nonassessable shares of the common stock, without par value, and at the
       close of business on such date, each holder of record of common stock
       shall, without further action, be and become the holder of [a number not
       to exceed one, to be established by the Board of Directors] additional
       share of common stock for each share of common stock held of record
       immediately prior thereto as determined by the Board of Directors.
       Effective at the close of business on such date, each certificate
       representing shares of common stock outstanding or held in treasury
       immediately prior to such time shall continue to represent the same
       number of shares of common stock and as promptly as practicable
       thereafter, the corporation shall issue and cause to be delivered to
       each holder of record of shares of common stock at the close of business
       on such date an additional certificate or certificates representing [a
       number, not to exceed one, to be established by the Board of Directors]
       additional share of common stock for each share of common stock held of
       record immediately prior thereto."

                                  APPENDIX B

                            AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER

   Role.  The principal role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of
Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities applicable to the
company's auditing, accounting and financial reporting processes and the
company's system of internal control. Consistent with this role, the Committee
is to encourage continuous improvement of, and foster adherence to, the
company's policies, procedures and practices at all levels. The Committee's
primary duties and responsibilities are to:

    .  Serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the company's
       financial reporting process and internal control system;

    .  Review and appraise the audit activities of the company's independent
       auditor and internal audit staff; and

    .  Foster open communication among the independent auditor, financial and
       senior management, internal audit and the Board of Directors.

   Composition.  The Committee shall be comprised of three or more directors as
determined by the Board, each of whom shall be independent directors, and free
from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with
the exercise of his or her independent judgment as a member of the Committee.
To be a member of the Committee, a director must satisfy the independence
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, all Committee
members must be financially literate and at least one member shall have
accounting or related financial management expertise, both as may be determined
from time to time by the Board of Directors in the exercise of its business
judgment.

   As soon as practical after the annual meeting of shareholders each year, the
Board shall appoint the Committee to serve for the ensuing twelve months or
until their successors shall be duly appointed and qualified. The Committee may
elect a chairman and may make rules for the conduct of its business and appoint
such committees and assistants as it may deem necessary. A majority of the
members of the committee shall constitute a quorum.

   Meetings.  The Committee shall meet at least four times annually, or more
frequently as the Committee may determine. As part of its role to foster open
communication, the Committee should meet semiannually with internal audit and
the independent auditor in separate executive sessions to discuss any matters
that the Committee or any of these groups believe should be discussed privately.

   Responsibilities.  In fulfilling its responsibilities and duties the
Committee shall generally perform the following functions, subject to such
modifications as the Committee may, from time to time, determine to be
necessary or appropriate:

    .  Recommend to the Board of Directors the selection and retention of the
       independent auditor who audits the financial statements of the company.
       In so doing, the Committee will: consider matters which might affect the
       auditor's independence, including the provision of non-audit services;
       discuss and consider the auditor's written affirmation that the auditor
       is in fact independent; discuss the nature and rigor of the audit
       process; receive and review all reports from the auditor; and provide to
       the independent auditor full access to the Committee (and the Board) to
       report on any and all matters deemed to be appropriate. It is recognized
       that the independent auditor is ultimately accountable to the Committee
       and the Board of Directors of the company.

                                      B-1

<PAGE>

    .  Provide guidance and oversight to the internal audit function of the
       company including review of the organization, plans and results of such
       activities.

    .  Review the financial statements and related information in the annual
       report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K with
       management and the independent auditor and make a recommendation to the
       Board as to whether or not the audited financial statements should be
       included in the Form 10-K. It is anticipated that these reviews will
       include discussions of the quality of earnings, discussions of
       significant items subject to management's judgment or estimate,
       consideration of the suitability of accounting principles, consideration
       of audit adjustments whether or not recorded and such other inquiries
       and discussions as may be appropriate.

    .  Review the interim financial statements and related information in the
       quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-Q
       with financial management and the independent auditor prior to its
       filing.

    .  Discuss with management and the auditors the quality and adequacy of the
       company's internal controls.

    .  Report on Committee activities to the full Board and prepare annually a
       summary report suitable for submission to the shareholders in the proxy
       statement.

    .  Establish, review and update periodically a Code of Conduct and review
       the systems and practices that management has established to enforce the
       Code.

    .  Perform any other activities consistent with this charter, the company's
       by-laws and governing law, as the Committee or the Board deems necessary
       or appropriate.

   Revision and Publication of Charter. In addition to its other
responsibilities, the Committee shall review the adequacy and appropriateness
of this charter at least annually and make recommendations to the Board with
respect thereto. The charter will be included in the proxy statement at least
every three years.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

BUSINESS

   TXU Corp. is a global energy services company that engages in electricity
generation, wholesale energy trading, retail energy marketing, energy delivery,
other energy-related services and, through a joint venture, telecommunications
services.

   During the periods for which financial information is presented in this
report, TXU Corp. had five reportable operating segments: US Electric, US Gas,
US Energy, Europe and Australia. The remainder of the businesses consist of the
telecommunications joint venture and other corporate level activities. (See
Note 16 to Financial Statements for information concerning reportable business
segments.) TXU Corp. was reorganized as of January 1, 2002, and since that date
has three reportable segments: US Energy, International Energy and US Energy
Delivery.

   Certain comparisons in this report have been affected by TXU Europe's
acquisition of Stadtwerke Kiel AG in Germany in January 2001 and Norweb Energi
in the UK in August 2000; and TXU Australia's acquisition of Optima Energy Pty
Ltd. (Optima) in May 2000 and its gas retail business and gas distribution
business in 1999. These acquisitions were accounted for as purchase business
combinations. The results of operations of each acquired company are included
in the consolidated financial statements of TXU Corp. only for the periods
subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition.

   The following exchange rates have been used to convert foreign currency
denominated amounts into US dollars, unless they were determined using exchange
rates on the date of a specific event:

   Derivatives and financial instruments -- TXU Corp. accounts for derivatives
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". SFAS No. 133
requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the
measurement of those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded in earnings, unless (i) the normal purchase or sale
exception or (ii) hedge accounting is elected.

                                      C-5

   TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments, including
options, swaps, futures, forwards and other contractual commitments for both
non-trading (i.e., hedging) and trading purposes. TXU Corp. and its domestic
and international subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments for
non-trading purposes in order to manage market risks related to changes in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

   TXU Corp. has designated, documented and assessed accounting hedge
relationships which mostly resulted in cash flow hedges that require TXU Corp.
to record the derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on its
balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income. Hedge
ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings. Amounts are removed from other
comprehensive income as the underlying transactions occur and realized gains
and losses are recorded.

   Although the amounts that ultimately would be recognized in the income
statement over the term of the derivatives are the same under any of the
methods used, it is the timing of the recognition of these amounts that is the
main difference in these methods. The determination of fair value is dependent
upon certain assumptions and judgments, as discussed in Energy trading
contracts and mark-to-market accounting below.

   The use of the normal purchase or sale exception from derivative
classification and the hedge accounting designation are elections that can be
made by management if certain strict criteria are met and documented. These
elections can reduce the volatility in earnings resulting from fluctuations in
fair value. Results of operations could be materially affected by elections of
normal purchase or sale or hedge accounting for qualifying derivative contracts.

   Energy trading contracts and mark-to-market accounting -- All energy trading
contracts, whether or not derivatives under SFAS No. 133, are accounted for
under the mark-to-market method of accounting as required by US GAAP. Energy
trading portfolios, which may include volumetric forecasts, are valued at
current market prices. This marking-to-market process recognizes changes in the
value of trading portfolios associated with market price fluctuations. Under
mark-to-market accounting, the current values of energy-related contracts are
recorded as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and any period-to-period
change in the current value of such contracts is recognized in the statement of
income.

   In the energy trading market, the availability of quoted market prices is
dependent on the type of commodity (e.g., natural gas, electricity, etc.), time
period specified and location of delivery. In computing the mark-to-market
valuations, each market segment is split into liquid and illiquid portions. The
liquid portion varies by region, time period and commodity. Generally, the
liquid period is supported by broker quotes and frequent trading activity. In
illiquid periods, little or no market information may exist, and the fair value
is estimated through market modeling techniques.

   For those periods where quoted market prices are not available, forward
price curves are developed based on the available trading information or
through the use of industry accepted modeling techniques and practices based on
market fundamentals (e.g., supply/demand, replacement cost, etc.). As a matter
of policy, however, TXU Corp. generally does not recognize any income or loss
from the illiquid periods.

   In accounting for energy trading contracts, settlements of positions under
which energy ownership is exchanged (physical contracts) are recorded gross as
revenues and purchases. Gains and losses from settlements of financial
positions are recorded net as revenues. For energy trading contracts not yet
settled, whether financial or physical, changes in fair value are recorded net
as revenues. Such fair value changes are referred to as unrealized gains and
losses from mark-to-market valuations. When positions are settled and gains and
losses are realized, the previously recorded unrealized gains and losses from
mark-to-market valuations are reversed.

                                      C-6

<PAGE>

   Revenue recognition -- TXU Corp. records revenue for retail and other energy
sales and services under the accrual method. However, the fair market values of
sales contracts determined to be derivative instruments and not designated as
normal sales under SFAS No. 133 are recognized upon inception under
mark-to-market accounting, and unrealized mark-to-market valuations are
recorded net as revenues. Electricity transmission and distribution and gas
distribution sales revenues are recognized when services are provided to
customers on the basis of periodic cycle meter readings and include an
estimated accrual for the value of electricity and gas provided from the meter
reading date to the end of the period.

   The historical financial statements included adjustments made to revenues in
the US Electric segment for over/under recovered fuel costs. To the extent fuel
costs incurred exceeded regulated fuel factor amounts included in customer
billings, US Electric recorded revenues on the basis of its ability and intent
to obtain regulatory approval for rate surcharges on future customer billings
to recover such amounts. Conversely, to the extent fuel costs incurred have
been less than amounts included in customer billings, revenues have been
reduced since US Electric has been required to adjust rates in future customer
billings. Following deregulation of the Texas market, fuel factor amounts will,
if necessary, be applied prospectively; consequently, recorded revenues will no
longer reflect such fuel cost adjustments.

   Depreciation -- The depreciable lives of unregulated power generation plants
are based on management's estimates/determinations of the plants' economically
useful lives. To the extent that the actual lives differ from these estimates
there would be an impact on the amount of depreciation charged to the financial
statements.

   Regulatory assets and liabilities -- The financial statements of TXU Corp.'s
regulated businesses reflect regulatory assets and liabilities under cost-based
rate regulation in accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effect of
Certain Types of Regulation." TXU Corp. has become less reliant upon regulated
operations since implementation of the Texas 1999 Restructuring Legislation.
Accordingly, application of SFAS No. 71 to the generation portion of the TXU
Corp.'s business was discontinued as of June 30, 1999. Only the electric and
gas transmission and distribution businesses are regulated after January 1,
2002. The assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to
have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital
and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. (See Note 4 to
Financial Statements.)

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

2001 versus 2000

   TXU Corp.'s operating revenues increased $5.9 billion, or 27%, to $27.9
billion in 2001. The advance in revenue was driven by the Europe segment with
an increase of $5.7 billion, which reflected strong growth in wholesale energy
trading and the effect of businesses acquired in 2001 and 2000. Acquisitions of
energy businesses in the UK and Germany contributed $1.0 billion in revenue
growth. The balance of revenue growth reflected advances in US Electric of $147
million, US Gas of $122 million and US Energy of $74 million, partially offset
by a decline in Australia of $17 million, due to the translation effect of a
stronger US dollar. Operating revenue growth was also offset by the
contribution of a US telecommunications business to a joint venture (Pinnacle)
in August 2000. The telecommunications business posted 2000 revenues of $92
million before the transaction.

   Gross margin (operating revenue less energy purchased for resale and fuel
consumed) increased $576 million, or 8%, to $8.1 billion in 2001. The US Energy
segment provided $309 million of the increase, driven by an increase in
wholesale trading and risk management activity. Gross margin in

                                      C-7

<PAGE>

US Electric rose $213 million due primarily to lower regulatory earnings cap
adjustments that benefited revenues. Europe's gross margin grew $196 million
due to the impact of acquisitions. US Gas posted a gross margin decline of $38
million reflecting the absence of a gas processing business sold in 2000.
Australia reported a gross margin decline of $17 million due to the translation
effect of a stronger US dollar. The impact of the Pinnacle joint venture
transaction in 2000 offset gross margin growth by $92 million. Revenues and
gross margin in 2001 were favorably impacted by a $377 million net effect of
mark-to-market valuations of wholesale trading positions and new commercial and
industrial retail contracts.

   Operation and maintenance expense increased $636 million, or 20%, to $3.8
billion in 2001. The increase includes a net $206 million loss on disposals and
transfers of four generating plants in the UK and charges of $31 million in the
Europe segment related to the Enron Corporation bankruptcy. Operation and
maintenance expenses in Europe rose an additional $213 million, primarily
representing the effect of acquisitions and costs to support growth in trading
operations and competitive activities in UK retail operations. The US Energy
segment's operating expenses grew $144 million, due largely to expansion of
trading and retail energy services operations in anticipation of the
introduction of competition in the Texas electricity market. In the US Electric
segment, costs increased $106 million due primarily to higher generation
maintenance, bad debts driven by higher revenues and transmission costs. The US
Gas segment's increase reflected $39 million in higher costs led by bad debts
and maintenance costs, partially offset by the absence of $35 million of costs
relating to the gas processing business sold in 2000. The impact of the
Pinnacle joint venture transaction in 2000 offset operation and maintenance
expense growth by $67 million.

   All other operating expenses increased $132 million, or 7%, to $2.0 billion
in 2001. This increase was driven by higher gross receipts taxes in the US
Electric and US Gas segments due to higher revenues on which such taxes are
based. Amortization of goodwill increased $16 million to $220 million. Such
amortization ceased January 1, 2002 pursuant to a new accounting standard. See
Note 2 to Financial Statements.

   Operating income decreased $192 million, or 8%, to $2.3 billion in 2001. The
Europe segment drove the decline with $252 million in lower operating profits,
which reflected the $206 million loss on the UK generation plant transactions.
The US Gas segment's operating profits declined $78 million due to the lower
gross margin and higher operating expenses. Operating results in US Energy
improved $161 million due primarily to the mark-to-market gains reflected in
gross margin growth.

   Other income (deductions)--net decreased from income of $238 million in 2000
to a loss of $117 million in 2001. The 2001 period includes a $125 million loss
($88 million after-tax), after transaction costs, on the sale of the UK
electricity distribution business, a $27 million write-off ($18 million
after-tax) of regulatory assets in the US Electric segment pursuant to a
regulatory order, partially offset by a $73 million gain ($51 million
after-tax) on the sale of TXU Europe's investment in a Spanish power company.
The 2000 period includes a $53 million gain ($34 million after-tax) from the
sale of the assets of the natural gas processing business in the US Gas
segment, a $28 million gain ($18 million after-tax) on sale of land in US
Electric and a $30 million gain ($21 million after-tax) from the sale of TXU
Europe's investment in an Eastern European power company and a $44 million gain
($31 million after-tax) on the sale of its UK metering business. The change
also reflected a $35 million ($23 million after-taxes) increased equity loss in
the Pinnacle joint venture, reflecting a full year of results in 2001 compared
to a partial year in 2000.

   Interest expense and other charges net of interest income decreased $101
million, or 7%, to $1.4 billion in 2001. The decline reflected $47 million in
higher interest income related primarily to under-recovered fuel, lower
interest expense of $37 million due primarily to lower rates, and a $12 million
increase in capitalized interest.

                                      C-8

<PAGE>

   In 2001, there was an income tax benefit of $24 million, compared with
income tax expense of $337 million in 2000. The change resulted largely from
the tax effects of the UK generation plant transactions that reflected retained
UK tax benefits, reductions of related deferred tax liabilities and benefits
from foreign tax credits for US tax purposes. Excluding the effects of UK plant
transactions, the effective tax rate was 31% in 2001 compared to 27% in 2000.
The increase was primarily due to higher state income taxes.

   Income before extraordinary items decreased $85 million, or 9%, to $831
million in 2001. Amounts per share of common stock were $3.12 for 2001 compared
with $3.43 for 2000. The decline in earnings reflected a net loss of $16
million in the US Gas segment compared to net income of $49 million in 2000, a
decline in net income in the Europe segment of $57 million and the $35 million
($23 million after-tax) increased loss on the Pinnacle equity investment,
partially offset by net income in the US Energy segment of $6 million compared
to a net loss of $88 million in 2000. The US Electric segment (before the
extraordinary loss) and Australia posted small declines in net income. As
comparisons of segment results are impacted by a number of transactions and
certain unusual items in both 2001 and 2000, this analysis should be read in
conjunction with the analysis of results of each business segment presented
below.

   The US Electric segment recorded an extraordinary loss in 2001 of $154
million (net of income tax benefit of $115 million.). The extraordinary loss
consisted of $97 million (net of $52 million income tax benefit) of charges
related to the reacquisition of debt under the debt restructuring and
refinancing plan pursuant to the requirements of the 1999 Restructuring
Legislation and $57 million (net of $63 million income tax benefit) of net
charges related to a pending settlement with the Texas Public Utility
Commission (Commission) to resolve all major open issues related to the
transition to deregulation. (See Note 6 to Financial Statements.)

   Net income available for common stock in 2001 decreased $249 million, or
28%, to $655 million. Earnings per share were $2.52 in 2001 compared with $3.43
in 2000. A 2% decline in average shares outstanding had a favorable impact of
$0.06 on the comparison of earnings per share. The decline in net income
reflected the extraordinary items and certain transactions and unusual items as
discussed above.

2000 versus 1999

   TXU Corp.'s operating revenues increased $4.9 billion, or 29%, to $22
billion in 2000. This was primarily due to the acquisitions of Norweb Energi
and Optima, the expansion of energy trading in Europe, increased customer
growth, warmer summer and colder winter weather in the US, higher fuel revenues
in the US Electric and US Gas segments and increased wholesale volumes traded
coupled with higher natural gas prices in the US Energy segment.

   Gross margin decreased $261 million, or 3%, to $7.6 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a $328 million
decrease for the Europe segment, partially offset by a $160 million increase in
margin for the US Electric segment. Results for the Europe segment were
adversely impacted by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM)
Distribution Price Controls, which reduced rates by 28% effective April 1,
2000. The growth in the US Electric segment was due to the increase in fuel
revenue, growth and customer demand, including hotter than normal summer
weather and an extremely cold fourth quarter 2000. US Gas posted a gross margin
decline of $8 million due primarily to the effect of the absence of a gas
processing business sold in 2000, partially offset by improved margins in gas
distribution. US Energy posted a gross margin decline of $20 million due
primarily to decreased trading margins. Australia reported a gross margin
decline of $29 million due primarily to the sale of its construction and
engineering business, Enetech.

                                      C-9

<PAGE>

   Operation and maintenance expense decreased $101 million, or 3%, to $3.2
billion in 2000 due to the sale of the gas processing business in May 2000 in
the US Gas segment, savings generated from the integration of electric and gas
operations in Australia, and reductions in costs due to corporate cost
reduction programs in Europe begun in prior years. Partially offsetting the
decreases were restructuring costs incurred in Europe primarily associated with
the establishment of 24seven and other corporate restructurings.

   All other operating expenses decreased $43 million, or 2%, to $1.9 billion
primarily due to lower depreciation expense in the US Electric segment,
partially offset by higher goodwill amortization in 2000 for the Europe
segment. As a result of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, earnings in excess
of the regulatory earnings cap (mitigation) was no longer recorded as
depreciation expense on nuclear production assets; instead mitigation was
recorded as a reduction of revenues, with an offsetting amount recorded as a
regulatory liability.

   Other income (deductions)--net decreased from income of $262 million in 1999
to $238 million in 2000. The 2000 period includes a $53 million gain ($34
million after-tax) from the sale of substantially all of the assets of the
natural gas processing business in the US Gas segment, a $28 million gain
($18 million after-tax) on sale of land in US Electric and a $30 million gain
($21 million after-tax) from the sale of TXU Europe's investment in an Eastern
European power company and $44 million gain ($31 million after-tax) on the sale
of its UK metering business. Results for 1999 included a $222 million gain
($145 million after-tax) from the sale of the 20% interest in PrimeCo Personal
Communications LP (PrimeCo) and the benefit of a change in accounting method at
TXU Europe of $14 million ($10 million after-tax).

   Interest expense and other charges net of interest income increased $40
million, or 3%, to $1.5 billion in 2000. The increase is due to a $25 million
increase in distributions on trust securities and $11 million in higher
interest expense.

   The overall effective income tax rate for 2000 was 27% compared to 31% for
1999. The year 2000 benefited from lower state income taxes, foreign tax
credits, the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters relating to
prior tax issues and other tax benefits associated with non-US operations.
Partially offsetting these favorable items was greater non-deductible goodwill
amortization in 2000.

   Net income available for common stock for 2000 was $904 million ($3.43 per
share) compared with $985 million ($3.53 per share) for 1999. A 5% decline in
average shares outstanding had a favorable impact of $0.21 on the comparison of
earnings per share. Earnings for 1999 included a $145 million after-tax gain
from the sale of the 20% interest in PrimeCo. Earnings for 2000 reflect
improved contributions from the US Electric, US Gas and Australia segments,
offset by weaker results of the US Energy and Europe segments. As comparisons
of segment results are impacted by a number of transactions and certain unusual
items in both 2000 and 1999, this analysis should be read in conjunction with
the analysis of results of each business segment presented below.

ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES

   The table below summarizes the changes in energy trading assets and
liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2001. The net change, excluding
"other activity" as described below, of $377 million represents the effect of

</TABLE>

   As the above table indicates, approximately 86% of the unrealized
mark-to-market valuations at December 31, 2001 mature within three years. This
is reflective of the terms of the positions and the conservative methodologies
employed in valuing positions in periods of decreased market liquidity and
visibility. The "prices actively quoted" category reflects only exchange traded
contracts with active quotes available through 2004 in the US and in certain
European markets through 2011. The "prices provided by other external sources"
category represents forward commodity positions at locations for which over-the
counter (OTC) broker quotes are available. OTC quotes for natural gas and power
generally extend through 2010 and 2007 in the US, and 2011 in Europe,
respectively. This category also includes values of large commercial and
industrial retail sales contracts. The "prices based on models" category
contains the value of all non-exchange traded options, valued using an industry
accepted option pricing model. In addition, this category contains other
contractual arrangements which may have both forward and option components. In
many instances, these contracts can be broken down into their component parts
and modeled by TXU Corp. as simple forwards and options based on prices
actively quoted. As the modeled value is ultimately the result of a combination
of prices from two or more different instruments, it has been included in this
category.

2001 versus 2000

   The US Electric segment's operating revenues increased by $147 million, or
2%, to $7.6 billion in 2001. This increase is primarily due to the impact on
reported revenues of regulation, as indicated by the net changes in base rate
revenues and earnings in excess of the regulatory earnings cap (mitigation).
The earnings cap is based largely on invested capital and to the extent
calculated earnings have been above allowed returns on invested capital,
revenues have been reduced. Increases in operating expenses, unless determined
to be unrecoverable, have generally resulted in

                                     C-12

<PAGE>

decreases in such mitigation adjustments. Energy sales in gigawatt-hours
declined 1% due to milder, more normal weather and a slowing economy, partially
offset by the effect of 2% growth in number of customers.

   Gross margin increased by $213 million, or 5%, to $4.6 billion in 2001. This
increase is primarily due to lower regulatory earnings cap adjustments that
benefited revenues.

   Income before extraordinary items decreased by $12 million, or 1%, to $871
million in 2001. Results in 2001 included a $27 million ($18 million after-tax)
write-off of a regulatory asset, pursuant to a regulatory order, and results in
2000 included a $44 million ($28 million after-tax) favorable adjustment
related to the 1999 mitigation calculation and a $28 million ($18 million
after-tax) gain on an asset sale.

   Results in 2001 also reflected increases in generation maintenance, bad
debts and transmission costs as well as higher state and local gross receipts
taxes and regulatory assessments. The increase in bad debts and gross receipts
taxes was primarily due to the rise in fuel costs and related revenue in late
2000 and early 2001. These items were partially offset by higher interest
income on under-recovered fuel costs. In addition, operating expenses in both
years reflect certain recoverable charges (write-offs of regulatory assets of
$73 million in 2001 and $52 million in 2000).

   On December 31, 2001, US Holdings filed a settlement plan with the
Commission that, if approved, will resolve all major open issues related to US
Holdings' transition to deregulation and will supersede certain ongoing
proceedings. See Regulatory Settlement Plan in Note 4 to Financial Statements
for more information.

   The US Electric segment recorded an extraordinary charge of $154 million
(after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2001. This charge includes unrecoverable
debt reacquisition expenses necessitated by required refinancings to make the
transition to deregulation, as well as the effects of the pending regulatory
settlement. See Note 5 to Financial Statements.

2000 versus 1999

   Operating revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 19%, to $7.5 billion in 2000.
This increase in operating revenues was due to the increase in fuel revenue,
customer growth and increased demand, and the effects of hotter than normal
summer weather and an extremely cold fourth quarter 2000, partially offset by
the reduction of revenues as a result of the regulatory earnings cap
(mitigation) and the fuel reconciliation settlement in 1999. Following the 1999
Restructuring Legislation, mitigation has been recorded as a reduction of
revenues, with a corresponding regulatory liability recorded, instead of
depreciation expense on nuclear production assets. Results in 2000 included a
$44 million ($28 million after-tax) favorable adjustment related to the 1999
mitigation calculation. Electric energy sales volumes for 2000 were 6% higher
than in 1999. Fuel revenues for 2000 were $1.0 billion higher than in 1999,
primarily as a result of increased fuel prices and higher energy sales.

   Net income increased by $110 million, or 14%, to $883 million in 2000,
reflecting increased revenues, a $28 million gain ($18 million after-tax) on an
asset sale and lower interest expense and other charges due to the
reacquisition of long-term debt and remarketing of certain debt to lower
interest rates. Operation and maintenance expenses rose as a result of a $52
million recoverable write-off of certain restructuring expenses and other
regulatory assets and increased regulated third-party transmission rates.
Excluding these items, operation and maintenance expenses were up less than 1%.
In addition, depreciation and other amortization expense was $31 million lower
in 2000 compared to 1999, which included mitigation depreciation of $52
million. Results for 1999 were impacted by a fuel reconciliation settlement
that reduced 1999 net income by $31 million.

2001 versus 2000

   The US Gas segment's operating revenues increased $122 million, or 11%, to
$1.2 billion in 2001. This increase reflects higher gas distribution prices
(from higher natural gas costs and revenue enhancement activities) and volumes,
primarily as a result of the colder winter weather in the first quarter of
2001, partially offset by a $54 million effect of the absence of revenues from
the gas processing business sold in May 2000.

   Gross margin declined $38 million, or 8%, to $465 million, primarily due to
a $42 million effect of the gas processing business sold in 2000. The lower
gross margin also reflected certain gas cost adjustments that are unrecoverable
under regulatory mechanisms.

   The US Gas segment had a net loss of $16 million in 2001 compared to net
income of $49 million in 2000. Results in 2000 included a $53 million ($34
million after-tax) gain on the sale of the gas processing business. The weaker
results also reflect the decrease in gross margin discussed above, higher
operating expenses in several categories, including gross receipts taxes, due
to higher revenues on which such taxes are based, bad debts, and maintenance
costs to improve system reliability. The increase in gross receipts taxes and
bad debts was primarily due to the rise in natural gas costs and related
revenue in late 2000 and early 2001. These increases were partially offset by a
favorable settlement of a gas purchase contract and lower net interest expense.

<PAGE>

2000 versus 1999

   The US Gas segment's operating revenues increased $239 million, or 28%, to
$1.1 billion in 2000, driven by gas distribution operations. This increase
reflects the revenue effect of the rise in prices for natural gas experienced
in 2000 and increased demand for natural gas due to colder winter weather.

   Net income increased $45 million, to $49 million in 2000. Results in 2000
included a $53 million ($34 million after-tax) gain on the sale of the gas
processing business. Operating results for 2000 also reflected increased margin
for gas distribution operations due to rate relief granted, significantly
increased volumes distributed in response to colder winter weather, and cost
reductions. Net income for 1999 included gains of $8 million from the sale of
assets.

2001 versus 2000

   The US Energy segment's operating revenues increased $74 million, or 1%, to
$5.6 billion in 2001. This growth reflected unrealized gains from
mark-to-market valuations of wholesale trading positions and certain retail
contracts (see discussion of gross margin) and higher wholesale power
(electricity) sales. Physical wholesale power volumes sold grew 19% during
2001. This growth was partially offset by lower natural gas sales. Physical gas
volumes sold declined 30%, although average gas sales prices rose 37%.

   Gross margin increased $309 million to $387 million in 2001. The growth
reflected increased power trading activities in the ERCOT region in
anticipation of deregulation in Texas, as well as increased trading in markets
outside of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Revenues and

                                     C-15

<PAGE>

gross margin in 2001 were impacted favorably by a $219 million net effect of
mark-to-market valuations of wholesale trading positions. In addition, during
2001 the retail energy services business began entering into contracts with
large commercial and industrial customers for electricity deliveries in Texas.
The contracts for such deliveries are derivatives, and $88 million in
origination gains were recorded upon inception of these contracts. An
additional $38 million in origination gains were recorded in 2001 primarily
related to commercial and industrial retail contracts for sales of natural gas,
but $31 million in gains were realized within the year, as the majority of the
contracts are short-lived.

   The US Energy segment had net income of $6 million in 2001 compared to a net
loss of $88 million in 2000. The improved results reflected the higher
out-of-ERCOT trading margins, optimization of the forward ERCOT positions and
retail energy services margins. These benefits were partially offset by higher
spending for staffing and computer systems to support expanded trading and
retail operations, largely in anticipation of deregulation of the Texas
electricity market on January 1, 2002. In 2001, US Energy recorded $18 million
principally for writedown in values of certain investments.

2000 versus 1999

   Operating revenues for the US Energy segment increased $2.4 billion, or 79%,
to $5.5 billion in 2000. This growth reflected a more than three fold increase
in wholesale power sales volumes and a 13% increase in wholesale natural gas
sales volumes, as well as significantly higher natural gas prices.

   The US Energy segment posted a net loss of $88 million in 2000, which was
$45 million, or 105%, more than in 1999. Results for 2000 reflect lower margins
on energy trading activities, costs associated with moving the trading
operations to Dallas, continued planned expenditures to prepare the trading and
retail operations for the opening of the Texas electricity market to
competition, increased interest expense and other charges to finance expansion
of the business and higher bad debt expense. Partially offsetting the increase
in costs was higher interest income on margin deposits.

* Includes results of acquired businesses from dates of acquisitions.

2001 versus 2000

   TXU Europe's operating revenues increased by $5.7 billion, or 81%, to $12.7
billion in 2001. On a pound sterling basis, the increase in revenues was 92%.
This increase is primarily the result of the continued expansion of wholesale
trading activity in the UK, Nordic and Central European markets. Wholesale
electricity and gas physical sales volumes in 2001 increased 33% and 50%,
respectively, over 2000. Trading activity in the UK increased partially as a
result of the implementation of the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA)
in March 2001 which eliminated the old Pool system and allows contracts to be
made directly between counterparties. Acquisitions of a retail business in the
UK in 2000 and a utility and retail business in Germany in 2001 provided $1.0
billion of the revenue growth.

   Revenues from TXU Europe's electricity distribution (networks) business,
which was sold in January 2002, were $454 million in 2001 and $535 million in
2000. The decrease primarily reflects the adverse impact of the OFGEM
Distribution Price Controls, which reduced rates by 28% effective April 1, 2000.

   Gross margin increased $196 million, or 9%, to $2.3 billion in 2001,
reflecting the impact of acquisitions and a $65 million ($45 million after-tax)
benefit from renegotiating a power supply contract. Revenues and gross margin
in 2001 were favorably impacted by a $58 million net effect of mark-to-market
valuations of trading positions.

   The Europe segment reported a decline in net income of $57 million, or 27%,
to $158 million in 2001. Results for 2001 included a $125 million ($88 million
after-tax) loss, after transaction costs, on the sale of the networks business,
$80 million ($56 million after-tax) in restructuring charges related primarily
to outsourcing retail customer service operations and establishing the 24seven
joint venture to manage UK networks operations and a $31 million ($22 million
after-tax) net charge related to the Enron bankruptcy. Other activity in 2001
related to TXU Europe's power portfolio and related investments included a $206
million loss ($15 million after-tax) on disposals and transfers of UK
generation plants, and a $73 million ($51 million after-tax) gain on the sale
of an investment in a Spanish power company. Results for 2000 included $120
million ($85 million after-tax) in restructuring charges primarily related to
the retail and networks operations as described above, a $44 million ($31
million after-tax) gain on sale of the UK metering business and a $30 million
($21 million after-tax) gain on sale of an investment in an Eastern European
power company.

                                     C-17

<PAGE>

   The low effective tax rate on the disposals and transfers of generation
plants in the UK reflected retained UK tax benefits and reductions of related
deferred tax liabilities.

   In addition to the effects of the above items, the decline in net income
from 2000 reflected less volatility in wholesale power prices, which reduced
profit opportunities in the UK trading operations, competitive pressures in the
UK retail operations, lower profits in the networks business due to lower
regulated rates and the unfavorable translation impact of a stronger US dollar.

   The income tax benefit of $263 million in 2001 includes $152 million of
foreign tax credits for US tax purposes associated with generation plant
dispositions and transfers.

2000 versus 1999

   TXU Europe's operating revenues increased by $954 million, or 16%, to $7.0
billion in 2000. On a pound sterling basis, the increase in revenues was 24%.
The increase is primarily due to expansion of wholesale trading activity.
Wholesale electricity and gas sales volumes in 2000 increased 27% and 124%,
respectively, over 1999. Revenues from the energy retail operations declined,
reflecting the addition of customers from the Norweb Energi business that was
more than offset by a reduction in revenues from other customers. Networks
revenues were $535 million for 2000 compared with $657 million for 1999. The
decrease primarily reflects the adverse impact of the OFGEM Distribution Price
Controls, which reduced rates by 28% effective April 1, 2000, partially offset
by higher unit sales. In response to the rate reduction, the distribution joint
venture, 24seven, was created to provide distribution services to customers at
lower cost.

   The Europe segment reported a decline in net income of $65 million, or 23%,
to $215 million in 2000. The decrease primarily reflects the adverse impact of
the OFGEM Distribution Price Controls and the strengthening of the US dollar
against the pound sterling, which decreased net income approximately $16
million. Results for 2000 also included restructuring charges associated with
the creation of the joint venture 24seven, the contracting of TXU Europe's
customer service function to Vertex Data Science Limited (Vertex) and for other
staff reorganizations. Partially offsetting these costs was a gain from the
sale of the UK metering business and a gain on the sale of TXU Europe's
interest in a power company in Eastern Europe.

* Includes results of acquired businesses from dates of acquisitions.

2001 versus 2000

   Operating revenues decreased $17 million, or 2%, to $700 million in 2001,
primarily the effect of the stronger US dollar. Australian dollar revenues
increased A$111 million or 9% in 2001. This improvement reflected an increase
in the number of customers, a full year of revenue in 2001 from a power
generation plant acquired in May 2000 and favorable wholesale trading results.
Partially offsetting this increase was lower electric distribution revenue due
to lower tariffs.

   Gross margin decreased by $17 million, or 4%, to $368 million in 2001.
Australian dollar gross margin increased 7%, largely in line with the revenue
growth. Revenues and gross margin in 2001 were favorably impacted by a $4
million net effect of mark-to-market valuations of trading positions.

   Net income decreased $4 million, or 7%, to $53 million in 2001. Australian
dollar net income increased 6% reflecting the revenue growth and lower interest
rates, partially offset by a $16 million gain on the sale of Enetech in 2000.

2000 versus 1999

   Operating revenues increased $35 million, or 5%, to $717 million in 2000. On
an Australian dollar basis, the increase in revenues was 17%. The increase is
primarily due the effects of acquired businesses and new gas sales contracts
entered into in 2000. Partially offsetting these items were decreases in
electric revenues due to the competitive pressures experienced with electric
customer contract renewals in July 2000 and lower construction revenues due to
the sale of Enetech.

   The Australia segment's net income increased $51 million to $57 million in
2000. Results benefited from a decrease of $75 million in operation and
maintenance expenses due to cost savings achieved from integration of natural
gas operations and the sale of Enetech. Results for 2000 benefited from a full
year of merchant trading operations and operations of TXU Australia Gas
(acquired February 1999), results of Optima from its date of acquisition in May
2000, a gain from the sale of Enetech and additional income from the
underground gas storage facility. Partially offsetting these items was higher
interest expense and other charges due to increases in interest rates and
higher average debt balances primarily due to the recent acquisitions. Results
for 1999 included acquisition-related costs totaling $17 million after-tax.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

   TXU Corp. adopted SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001 and recorded a $132
million charge to other comprehensive income to reflect the cumulative fair
value of cash-flow-hedge derivatives at transition. The change in other
comprehensive income from cash flow hedges is related primarily to the change
in fair values and the exemption of certain energy contracts in Europe as
accounting hedges that meet the normal purchase and sale exception following
implementation of NETA and the implementation of new interpretations of SFAS
No. 133. (Sees Note 2 and 3 to Financial Statements.) The losses from currency
translation adjustments for all periods principally reflect the substantial
movement in exchange rates between the US dollar and the UK pound sterling and
the Australian dollar. The unrealized holding gains (losses) on investments are
primarily related to changes in market value of TXU Europe's equity investments
in power companies. The reclassification of gains realized on the sale of
investments relates to the sale in 2000 and 2001 of the same investments.

   TXU Corp. has historically used, and will continue to use, other derivatives
that are highly effective in offsetting future cash flow volatility in interest
rates, currency exchange rates and energy commodity prices. The fair value of
derivatives that are effective as cash flow hedges are recorded as derivative
assets or liabilities with an offset in other comprehensive income.

   The amounts included within other comprehensive income reflect the value of
the cash flow hedges, based on current market conditions, to be used in the
future to offset the impact on related payments of expected changes in prices.
The effects of the hedge will be recorded in the statement of income as the
related transaction is actually settled.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   Cash Flows  -- Cash flows provided by operating activities for 2001 were
$2.3 billion compared to $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion for 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The increase in 2001 of $584 million, or 35%, was primarily
driven by collections of the prior year's under-recovered fuel costs in the US
Electric segment. The decline in 2000 of $488 million, or 22%, was also due
primarily to the under-recovered fuel costs. Due to the significant increase in
natural gas costs in 2000, the US Electric segment did not recover through
customer billings all of its fuel costs incurred. Subsequent regulatory
proceedings resulted in approved rate increases that allowed substantial cost
recovery during 2001.

   Cash flows provided from investing activities for 2001 totaled $67 million.
This compares to $1.2 billion and $3.1 billion used for investing activities in
2000 and 1999, respectively. Acquisition activity declined to $225 million in
2001, compared to $809 million and $1.0 billion in 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Proceeds from the sale of assets were $1.5 billion in 2001 compared with $832
million in 2000 and $91 million in 1999. (See table below). Capital
expenditures were $1.6 billion for 2001, compared with $1.4 billion and $1.6
billion for 2000 and 1999, respectively. Included in cash flow for 2001 was
$509 million of restricted cash that was released upon the transfer of certain
UK power plants under leasing agreements.

   Cash flows used in financing activities for 2001 were $2.2 billion,
primarily reflecting the pay down of debt. Retirements and repurchases of debt
and equity securities totaled $8.5 billion and issuances totaled $7.1 billion.
Net redemptions of commercial paper totaled $1.0 billion, and notes payable to
banks increased $1.1 billion. As a result of the unbundling of US Holdings and
related refinancings, there were substantial early retirements and issuances of
long-term debt and retirements of preferred securities for 2001. Cash flows
from financing activities were $13 million in 2000 and $782 million in 1999.
Cash dividends paid approximated $640 million in each of the three years.

   On January 18, 2002, TXU Europe completed the sale of its UK electricity
distribution (networks) business, and its 50% interest in 24seven to London
Electricity Group plc (LE Group) for $1.873 billion, consisting of a cash
payment of $801 million and the assumption by LE Group of $1.072 billion
aggregate principal amount of debt. The transaction will result in
approximately $1.9 billion of debt reduction, consisting of $1.072 billion of
assumed debt and approximately $801 million of debt being repaid using the cash
proceeds from the sale.

   In December 2001, US Holdings agreed to sell its Handley and Mountain Creek
steam electric generating plants for $443 million in cash. The Handley plant
consists of five natural gas-fueled generating units with a total plant
capacity of 1,441 MW and is located in Fort Worth, Texas. The Mountain Creek
plant in Dallas, Texas consists of five natural gas-fueled generating units
with a total plant capacity of 893 MW. The transaction includes a purchase
power and tolling agreement for TXU Energy Trading to purchase power during
summer months for the next five years. The transaction is expected to be
completed in early 2002.

   Future Capital Requirements -- Capital expenditures are estimated at $1.6
billion for 2002 and are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations.
Approximately $800 million of this is for maintenance and organic growth of
existing operations. Approximately 34% is planned for our US energy business,
23% for our international energy business, 37% for our US energy delivery
business, and 6% for other activities. The remaining $800 million represents
discretionary spending on potential business opportunities. It is expected that
25 to 50 % will be in the international energy business, primarily in Europe,
and the rest in the US, primarily in the energy business.

   Changes in Capital -- During 2001, TXU Corp. had two equity purchase
agreements with separate financial institutions to repurchase shares of TXU
Corp.'s common stock. In April 2001, TXU Corp. repurchased 1,252,500 shares of
its common stock for $44 million under one of the equity purchase agreements.
Following that purchase, TXU Corp. terminated both contracts without purchasing
additional shares. Settlement of these agreements had no effect on earnings.
During 2000, TXU Corp. repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares of its
common stock for $596 million through open market purchases. No additional
repurchases are planned for 2002.

   Other Capital Transactions -- Beginning in August 2001, TXU Corp.'s
requirements under the Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan and
TXU Corp. Thrift Plan were met through additional issuances of common stock.

   Capitalization -- External funds of a permanent or long-term nature are
obtained through the issuance of common, preference and preferred stock, TXU
Corp. or subsidiary obligated, mandatorily redeemable, preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts, each holding solely junior subordinated debentures of TXU
Corp. or related subsidiary (trust securities) and long-term debt by TXU Corp.
and subsidiaries. The capitalization ratios of TXU Corp. at December 31, 2001,
consisted of approximately 59.3% long-term debt, less amounts due currently,
5.4% equity-linked debt securities, 2.7% trust securities, 0.8% preferred stock
of subsidiaries, 1.2% preference stock and 30.6% common stock equity. Not
reflected in these ratios is restricted cash of $520 million included in other
investments that collateralizes certain TXU Europe capital lease obligations.

   Equity-Linked Debt Securities -- In October 2001, TXU Corp. issued a total
of 20 million equity-linked debt securities (2001 Equity Units), each having an
initial stated amount per security of $50. These securities consist of purchase
contracts under which the holder will purchase from TXU Corp. shares of its
common stock on settlement dates in 2004 and 2005 and TXU Corp.'s Series K
Senior Notes due 2006 and Series L Senior Notes due 2007. Gross proceeds from
the offering were $1.0 billion. Net proceeds were used to repay commercial
paper. (See Note 7 to Financial Statements).

                                     C-22

<PAGE>

   TXU Corp.'s $700 million of equity-linked debt securities issued in 1998
(1998 Equity Units) consisted of purchase contracts, under which the holder
would purchase from TXU Corp., on settlement dates in 2001 and 2002, shares of
its common stock, and TXU Corp.'s Series D Senior Notes due 2003 and Series E
Senior Notes due 2004. On August 16, 2001, TXU Corp. issued 7.5 million shares
of common stock for $351 million in fulfillment of stock purchase contracts
with holders of these securities. Also, the coupon rate on the $350 million TXU
Corp. Series D Notes due 2003 was reset from 6.37% to 5.52% commencing August
16, 2001.

   US Debt Restructure -- During the fourth quarter of 2001, TXU Corp.
restructured its debt in connection with its plan for compliance with the 1999
Restructuring Legislation. As a result of the debt restructuring and
refinancings, TXU Corp. recorded an extraordinary charge of $97 million
after-tax. (See Notes 4 and 5 to Financial Statements).

   Issuances and Retirements -- During 2001, TXU Corp. or its subsidiaries
issued, redeemed, reacquired, defeased or made scheduled principal payments on
debt and trust securities for cash, as follows:

(a) US Holdings' borrowings under both facilities are limited to an aggregate
    amount outstanding at any one time of $2 billion. US Credit Agreements
    primarily support commercial paper borrowings of TXU Corp.
(b) At December 31, 2001, letters of credit outstanding under this agreement
    totaled $468 million.
(c) Outstanding borrowings were $275 million reflected in short-term notes
    payable-banks and $579 million reflected in long-term debt. The short-term
    borrowing was repaid in January 2002 with proceeds received from a UK plant
    sale.
(d) Tranche C was a bridge facility repaid and cancelled on January 21, 2002 in
    connection with the sale of the UK networks business.

   TXU Corp. and US Holdings have joint US dollar-denominated lines of credit
under revolving credit facility agreements (US Credit Agreements) with a group
of banking institutions that support TXU Corp.'s commercial paper program. TXU
Gas was removed as a borrower from both facilities effective January 1, 2002.
Short-term liquidity requirements of TXU Gas will be met through advances from
TXU Corp. All borrowed amounts outstanding under Facility A at the expiration
date must be repaid within one year. Facility B provides for the issuance of up
to $500 million of letters of credit. At December 31, 2001, there were no
borrowings outstanding under these facilities.

   Under the commercial paper program, $853 million was outstanding at December
31, 2001. TXU Corp. currently anticipates that it will continue to renew these
or comparable, appropriately-sized facilities on an annual basis. If it were
unable to renew these facilities, TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries would seek
other liquidity sources, either internally or within bank or capital markets.

   In connection with the unbundling of US Holdings, in December 2001, TXU
Corp. entered into a fully drawn $700 million credit facility (US Credit
Facility) with a financial institution that matures June 30, 2002. TXU Corp.
currently expects to repay this bridge facility with proceeds from capital
markets transactions by its subsidiaries.

   During 2002, TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries will have financing needs to
fund ongoing working capital requirements and maturities of long-term debt and
to refinance bridge facilities entered into in connection with the financial
restructuring of US Holdings in 2001. TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries intend to
fund these financing needs through the issuance of long-term debt and/or
equity. Other sources of funding include proceeds from asset sales, issuance of
commercial paper, bank borrowings, and loans from other subsidiaries. If these
options become unavailable for any reason, TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries could
borrow under their credit facilities. During 2002, TXU Corp. may repurchase
certain debt securities classified as long-term as of December 31, 2001. Such
classification is based on TXU Corp.'s ability and intent to fund such
repurchases through issuances of long-term debt.

   Europe -- Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement -- In connection with the
sale of its UK networks business, TXU Europe terminated the old Sterling Credit
Agreement, with all borrowings repaid along

                                     C-24

<PAGE>

with associated interest. A new Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, dated
November 19, 2001, immediately replaced the old senior debt facility. There are
three tranches in this facility. Tranche A is a multi-currency, (Pounds)800
million five-year revolver which allows for short-term borrowings and the
extension to a long-term basis. Tranche B is a (Pounds)230 million standby
facility to cover waivers needed on two letter of credit facilities. This was
not drawn upon and has been cancelled. Tranche C was a (Pounds)600 million
short-term bridge facility. This facility was repaid and cancelled in January
2002 upon receipt of proceeds from the UK networks sale. As of December 31,
2001, the outstanding borrowings under this facility were as follows:
short-term--Tranche A--(Pounds)190 million ($275 million) at 4.72% per annum
(repaid in January 2002 with proceeds from a plant sale) and Tranche
C--(Pounds)560 million ($813 million) at 4.70% per annum (also repaid in
January 2002); long-term--Tranche A--(Pounds)399 million ($579 million) of
various currency loans due 2006.

   Summary -- TXU Corp.'s goal is to continue to maintain credit ratings
necessary to allow TXU Corp. or its subsidiaries to access the commercial paper
market. If TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries were to experience a substantial
downgrade of their respective credit ratings, which they do not anticipate,
access to the commercial paper markets could no longer be possible, resulting
in the need to borrow under committed bank lines or seek other liquidity
sources.

   In order to borrow under these credit facilities, TXU Corp. must be in
compliance with the applicable covenants and certain other conditions. These
covenants consist principally of a total debt to capitalization ratio and a
fixed charge coverage ratio. Incremental borrowings that would increase the
outstanding principal amount borrowed would be prohibited if a material adverse
change, as defined in the applicable agreements, occurred. TXU Corp. is in
compliance with these covenants and meets the required conditions at December
31, 2001 and anticipates that it will remain in compliance. In the event TXU
Corp. were not in compliance with the applicable covenants and other
conditions, TXU Corp. may need to pursue alternative sources of funding.

   TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries may also from time to time utilize these
short-term facilities to temporarily fund maturities and early redemptions of
long-term debt and other securities, as well as its short-term requirements. If
TXU Corp and its subsidiaries were unable to access the capital markets to
refund these short-term borrowings, additional liquidity sources would be
necessary.

   Sale of Receivables -- TXU Corp., through its subsidiaries, has several
facilities to provide financing through sales of customer accounts receivable.
All of the facilities continually sell customer accounts receivables or
undivided interests therein to financial institutions on an ongoing basis to
replace those receivables that have been collected.

   TXU Corp. indirectly owns TXU Receivables Company, an unconsolidated
bankruptcy remote entity established in accordance with SFAS No. 140 to
purchase receivables. Prior to January 1, 2002, TXU Gas and US Holdings sold
certain customer accounts receivable to TXU Receivables Company which sells
undivided interests in accounts receivable it purchases to financial
institutions. As of January 1, 2002, the program was amended to terminate US
Holdings' participation and to add TXU Energy Retail Company LP, TXU SESCO
Energy Services Company and Oncor Electric Delivery Company as qualified
originators of accounts receivable under the program. As of December 31, 2001,
originators had sold $923 million face amount of receivables to TXU Receivables
Company under the program in exchange for cash of $500 million and $414 million
in subordinated notes, with $9 million representing the costs of the program
since inception in August 2001. Annualized costs of the program approximated
3.7% of the cash proceeds from the receivable sales. An additional $100 million
of cash related to the receivables sold as of December 31, 2001 was received
subsequent to year-end, bringing the total cash received for those receivables
to $600 million and reducing the notes by $100 million. TXU Receivables Company
funded the cash paid through sales of undivided interests in the

                                     C-25

<PAGE>

purchased receivables to financial institutions. See Note 6 to Financial
Statements. TXU Receivables Company purchases the receivables at a discount
that is adjusted periodically to reflect any changes in the credit risk profile
of the receivables, the costs of the program and other factors. The
subordinated notes receivable from TXU Receivables Company are included in
accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet.

   At December 31, 2001, accounts receivable of TXU Europe were reduced by
(Pounds)181 million ($263 million) under a program with a commercial bank, and
(Pounds)108 million ($157 million) of future receivables sold were reflected as
other short-term loans on the balance sheet. The amounts for short-term loans
bear interest at an annual rate, which was 4.13% at December 31, 2001, based on
commercial paper rates plus a margin. The program was amended in the third
quarter of 2001 and the overall limit was reduced to (Pounds)300 million.

   Europe -- EMTN Program -- At December 31, 2001, TXU Europe has a (Euro)2.0
billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) program, under which TXU Europe may from
time to time issue notes in various currencies. As of December 31, 2001, a
financing subsidiary of TXU Europe has (Pounds)301 million ($437 million) of 35
Put 5 Resettable Notes due 2035 (Resettable Notes) outstanding under the EMTN
program. The initial interest rate on the Resettable Notes, up to the first
reset date of November 30, 2005, is 7.7875%. The issuer of the Resettable Notes
has a call option to repurchase the Resettable Notes at par on November 30,
2005. This call option has been assigned to commercial banks for a
consideration of approximately (Pounds)5 million ($7 million) per annum for
five years. The Resettable Notes also include a put option that is exercisable
at November 30, 2005 by the holder and a reset feature that permits the holder
to remarket the Resettable Notes at a different interest rate if the put is not
exercised. On the reset date, the new interest rate will be determined in
accordance with the terms of the Resettable Notes for the next 6 to 20 years.
The Resettable Notes can be redeemed at principal plus accrued interest on
November 30, 2005.

   As of December 31, 2001, there was (Pounds)275 million ($399 million) in
7.25% Sterling Eurobonds due March 8, 2030 outstanding under the EMTN program.
TXU Europe has granted to the holders an optional put in 2015 in exchange for a
waiver of a provision that would have prohibited the disposition of the UK
networks business. A similar provision in the Resettable Notes has been waived
for a fee without any further changes to the terms of the Resettable Notes.

   See Notes 6, 7, 8 and 9 to Financial Statements for further details
concerning short-term financing, long-term debt, trust securities, and
preferred stock of subsidiaries.

   Regulatory Asset Securitization -- On December 31, 2001, US Holdings filed a
settlement plan with the Commission that, if approved, would provide for Oncor
to receive a financing order authorizing it to issue transition bonds in the
amount of $1.3 billion to monetize and recover its generation-related
regulatory assets. The settlement provides that there will be an initial
issuance of bonds in the amount of up to $500 million upon approval of the
settlement followed by a second issuance for the remainder after 2003. Proceeds
from the securitization will be used to reduce debt. This settlement resolves
all issues related to generation-related regulatory assets and liabilities. For
more information concerning securitization of regulatory assets, see Note 4 to
Financial Statements.

* Excludes $1.1 billion of debt assumed by LE Group in January 2002 in
  connection with the sale of the UK networks business and capital leases.

   TXU Corp. or its predecessor have declared common stock dividends payable in
cash in each year since incorporation in 1945. The Board of Directors of TXU
Corp., at its February 2002 meeting, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.60 a
share, payable April 1, 2002 to shareholders of record on March 8, 2002. Future
dividends may vary depending upon TXU Corp.'s profit levels and capital
requirements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time.

     Letters of credit...  $1,358   $997   $ --  $ --  $289  $ --     $72
</TABLE>

   The letters of credit relate primarily to lease transfers of certain
generation plants in the UK, an option of TXU Europe to provide future energy
sales, issuances under the US Credit Agreements discussed in Short-term
Financing and Liquidity Facilities above, and support of energy trading
activities. In the event of a draw on a letter of credit, the relevant TXU
Corp. company would have a corresponding reimbursement obligation to the issuer
of the letter of credit.

   In connection with a generation plant lease transfer, TXU Europe has
committed to provide additional letter of credit security of (Pounds)50 million
($73 million) in the event of a negative watch or downgrade of its debt
securities. TXU Europe has facilities available to satisfy this commitment.

   Other commitments and guarantees of TXU Corp. are discussed below.

CONTINGENCIES

   Financial Guarantees -- US Holdings has entered into contracts with public
agencies to purchase cooling water for use in the generation of electric energy
and has agreed, in effect, to guarantee the principal, $19 million at December
31, 2001, and interest on bonds issued by the agencies to finance the
reservoirs from which the water is supplied. The bonds mature at various dates
through 2011 and have interest rates ranging from 5 1/2% to 7%. US Holdings is
required to make periodic payments equal to such principal and interest,
including amounts assumed by a third party and reimbursed to US Holdings, of $4
million annually for the years 2002 through 2003, $7 million for 2004 and $1
million for

                                     C-27

<PAGE>

2005 and 2006. In addition, US Holdings is obligated to pay certain variable
costs of operating and maintaining the reservoirs. US Holdings has assigned to
a municipality all contract rights and obligations of US Holdings in connection
with $30 million remaining principal amount of bonds at December 31, 2001,
issued for similar purposes which had previously been guaranteed by US
Holdings. US Holdings is, however, contingently liable in the unlikely event of
default by the municipality.

   TXU Europe has guaranteed up to (Pounds)76 million ($110 million) at
December 31, 2001 of certain liabilities that may be incurred and payable by
the purchasers of The Energy Group (TEG)'s US and Australian coal business and
US energy marketing operations sold in 1998 prior to acquisition of TEG by TXU
Corp. These guarantees are with respect to the Peabody Holding Company
Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, the Powder River Coal Company
Retirement Plan and the Peabody Coal UMWA Retirement Plan, subject to certain
specified conditions.

   TEG entered into various guarantees of obligations of affiliates of its
former subsidiary Citizens Power LLC, arising under power purchase agreements
and note purchase agreements in connection with various Citizens Power energy
restructuring projects, as well as various indemnity agreements in connection
with such projects. TXU Europe and TEG continue to be either the guarantor or
the indemnifying party under these various agreements.

   In conjunction with various contracts requiring the payment of annual
capacity fees for power, at December 31, 2001, TXU Europe has provided a
(Pounds)300 million ($448 million) guarantee (declining over time) representing
approximately one year's capacity payment.

   TXU Corp. has also issued various guarantees to facilitate energy trading
operations and to secure commitments associated with certain outstanding debt
and lease agreements of TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries.

   Obligations with Respect to Investments in Partnerships and Other
Unconsolidated Entities -- In August 2000, TXU Corp. formed a joint venture
with third-party investors and contributed the stock of its telecommunications
subsidiaries to Pinnacle One Partners, L.P. (Pinnacle or the joint venture).
The businesses contributed had a net book value of $477 million, including
goodwill of $353 million. TXU Corp. received a 50% voting interest in the joint
venture and approximately $600 million in cash. Third-party investors
contributed $150 million in cash in exchange for the remaining 50% voting
interest. No gain or loss was recorded on the formation of the joint venture.
TXU Corp.'s investment in Pinnacle is accounted for using the equity method.
Assets of the joint venture are not TXU Corp.'s and are not available to pay
creditors of TXU Corp. Pinnacle's principal investment is in TXU Communications
Ventures Company (TXU Communications). TXU Communications operates a
diversified telecommunications business, including regulated incumbent local
exchange carriers, a competitive telecommunications service provider and a
fiber optic transport business.

   In connection with its formation, Pinnacle issued $810 million in senior
secured notes due August 15, 2004. The notes are secured by all of Pinnacle's
assets, including its shares of TXU Communications. Total proceeds (net of
transaction costs), including the $150 million received from third-party
investors, were used by Pinnacle to make the $600 million cash distribution to
TXU Corp. and fund a trust with $336 million. The principal and interest on the
trust funds is being used to pay interest on the senior secured notes and
distributions to the third-party investors. The trust invested in TXU Corp.
debt securities.

   TXU Corp. provides a $200 million revolving credit facility to TXU
Communications, expiring 2004, of which $153 million was outstanding as of
December 31, 2001. In addition, TXU Corp. has made and may make future capital
contributions to Pinnacle to fund a portion of TXU Communications' capital
expenditures. TXU Corp. also provides administrative services to Pinnacle and
its affiliates at cost.

                                     C-28

<PAGE>

   In connection with the Pinnacle transaction, TXU Corp. issued 810,000 shares
of Mandatorily Convertible Single Reset Preference Stock, Series C (Series C
Preference Stock) to Pinnacle One Share Trust, a consolidated trust (Share
Trust). The Series C Preference Stock is convertible into common stock of TXU
Corp. In the event of:

      (1) a default by Pinnacle in connection with its $810 million of senior
   secured notes,

      (2) a decline in the market price of TXU Corp. common stock below $21.93
   per share coupled with a decline in the credit rating for TXU Corp.'s
   unsecured, senior long-term obligations to or below BB by Standard & Poor's
   or Fitch or Ba by Moody's, or

      (3) Pinnacle's inability to raise sufficient cash to repay its senior
   secured notes 120 days prior to maturity through the sale of its shares of
   TXU Communications or the sale of assets of TXU Communications,

TXU Corp. would be required to sell equity or otherwise raise proceeds
sufficient to repay Pinnacle's senior secured notes. If TXU Corp. did not raise
sufficient proceeds, the Share Trust could be required to sell some or all of
the Series C Preference Stock. The dividend rate and conversion price of the
Series C Preference Stock would be reset at the time of sale to generate
proceeds sufficient to redeem the senior secured notes. TXU Corp. expects that
it would be able to sell equity or debt securities to satisfy its contingent
obligations to repay Pinnacle's debt.

   Had TXU Corp. been required to consolidate Pinnacle at December 31, 2001,
TXU Corp.'s debt would have increased by approximately $569 million. TXU Corp.
does not believe that a consolidation of Pinnacle would have had a material
impact on its liquidity or financial condition.

   For the year ended December 31, 2001, Pinnacle reported revenues of $209
million and incurred a net loss of $105 million, due largely to interest
expense on its senior secured notes. TXU Corp. recorded its equity in
Pinnacle's losses for the year of $53 million which is reflected in other
income (deductions) -- net. At December 31, 2001 Pinnacle had total assets of
approximately $1.1 billion (including goodwill of $336 million) and liabilities
of $1.1 billion.

   TXU Corp. has equity ownership interests in various other businesses which
are accounted for using the equity method. There are no material contingencies
related to these investments other than Pinnacle described above, and TXU Corp.
has not provided any guarantees related to these investments.

   Contingencies Related to Receivables Program -- If the sales of receivables
program described above terminates, cash flow to the originators would
temporarily stop until the undivided interests of the financial institutions
were repurchased. The level of cash flows would normalize in approximately 16
to 31 days. Although TXU Receivables Company expects to be able to pay its
subordinated notes from the collections of purchased receivables, these notes
are subordinated to the undivided interests of the financial institutions in
those receivables, and collections might not be sufficient to pay the
subordinated notes. The program may be terminated if either of the following
events occurs:

      (1) the credit rating for the long-term senior debt securities of both
   any originator and its parent guarantor, if any, declines below BBB- by
   Standard and Poor's or Baa3 by Moody's; or

      (2) the delinquency ratio (delinquent for 31 days) for the sold
   receivables exceeds 15% for any month, the default ratio (delinquent for 91
   days or deemed uncollectible) exceeds 5% for any month, or the dilution
   ratio (reductions for discounts, disputes and other allowances) exceeds 1%
   for any month.

The delinquency ratio and the dilution ratio exceeded the relevant thresholds
at various times during 2001, but the events were waived and the program was
not terminated.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

   Market risk is the potential loss TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries may incur
as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular instrument
or commodity. TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries are exposed to market risks
associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity
prices in both energy trading activities and non-trading operations. TXU
Corp.'s exposure to market risk is affected by a number of factors, including
the size, duration and composition of its energy portfolio, the absolute and
relative levels of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates,
commodity prices, as well as volatility and liquidity of markets. TXU Corp. and
its subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments for non-trading purposes in
order to manage exposures to changes in interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates and commodity prices. Through its energy trading subsidiaries,
TXU Corp. assumes certain market risks in an effort to generate gains from
market price differences. It does so through the use of derivative instruments,
including exchange traded and over-the-counter contracts, as well as through
other contractual commitments in its energy trading activities.

   RISK OVERSIGHT

   TXU Corp. and its energy trading subsidiaries manage the market, credit and
operational risk of the portfolio and its trading activities within limitations
imposed by their respective Boards of Directors and in accordance with TXU
Corp.'s overall risk management policies. Market risks are monitored daily
(weekly in Europe and Australia) by risk management groups that operate and
report independently of the trading operations, utilizing industry accepted
mark-to-market techniques and analytical methodologies. These techniques value
the portfolio of contracts and the hypothetical effect on this value from
changes in market conditions and include, but are not limited to, sensitivity
analyses and value at risk (VAR) methodologies.

   Energy trading subjects TXU Corp. to some inherent risks associated with
future contractual commitments, including market and operational risks credit
risk associated with counterparties, product location (basis) differentials and
market liquidity. Each entity, continuously monitors the valuation of
identified risks and adjusts the portfolio based on current market conditions.
Valuation adjustments or reserves are established in recognition that certain
risks exist until full delivery of energy has occurred, counterparties have
fulfilled their financial commitments and related financial instruments have
either matured or are closed out. Price and credit risks are further managed
within the established trading policies and limits established for each trading
entity.

   TXU Corp. and its energy trading subsidiaries assess trading risk using a
VAR methodology. This methodology is used to measure the amount of prospective
risk that exists within a portfolio under a variety of market conditions given
a portfolio's current position, net mark-to-market value, term and location.
VAR is a mathematical estimate of a portfolio's maximum potential for loss or
gain within a specified level of confidence (i.e., 95% certainty) due to market
movements utilizing standard statistical techniques and given historical and
projected market prices and volatilities. Stress testing of market variables is
also conducted to simulate and address abnormal market conditions.

   TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries have a corporate risk management organization
that is headed by a global chief risk officer. The chief risk officer through
his designees, establishes and enforces the VAR limits by region, including the
respective policies and procedures to ensure compliance with such limits and
evaluates the risks inherent in the various businesses of TXU Corp. and their
associated transactions. Key risk control activities include, but are not
limited to, credit review and approval, operational and market risk
measurement, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation and daily
portfolio reporting, including mark-to-market valuation, VAR and other risk
measurement metrics.

   COMMODITY PRICE RISK

   TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries are subject to the inherent risks of market
fluctuations in the price of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related
products marketed and purchased. TXU Corp.

                                     C-30

<PAGE>

actively manages its portfolio of owned generation, fuel supply and retail load
to mitigate the impacts of changing energy prices on its results of operations.
As part of managing the volatility inherent in these market risks, TXU Corp.
enters into hedging transactions to mitigate a significant portion of the
remaining exposures as part of its risk management program.

   NON-TRADING OPERATIONS -- TXU Corp. also engages in commodity-related
marketing and price risk management activities in order to hedge market risk
and exposure to prices of electricity, natural gas and fuel. For financial
reporting purposes, non-trading operations are defined as the normal generation
(including fuel consumed), purchase, sale and delivery of electricity and
natural gas for ultimate resale to residential and small commercial retail
customers. The objective of risk management related to non-trading operations
is the limiting of price risk related to the traditional asset-based
generation, production, distribution, or transmission activities of TXU Corp.

   The financial instruments used for non-trading purposes include primarily
forwards, futures, swaps and options. The gains and losses related to these
derivatives, to the extent effective as accounting hedges, are deferred in the
balance sheet and recognized in the income statement in the same period as the
settlement of the underlying physical transaction. TXU Corp.'s residential and
small commercial retail customer arrangements are not derivatives or trading
contracts; therefore, TXU Corp. uses accrual accounting for those transactions.

   Prior to deregulation of the electricity markets in Texas as of January 1,
2002, US Holdings and TXU Gas did not use derivative instruments to hedge price
risk of non-trading activities. On a limited basis in 2001, US Holdings entered
into derivative contracts for the sale of electricity beginning in 2002 in
connection with generation capacity auctions required by the 1999 Restructuring
Legislation. These contracts did not result in significant mark-to-market
valuations as of December 31, 2001.

   Nontrading Market Risk -- The hypothetical loss in fair value, arising from
an adverse movement in future prices of at least 10%, of TXU Corp.'s
derivatives and other contracts entered into for nontrading purposes in
existence at December 31, 2001 and 2000, using standard sensitivity analysis
techniques, was:

</TABLE>

   During 2001, following the implementation of NETA, some significant power
purchase arrangements in the UK changed from contracts for differences to
bilateral contracts or were terminated. As these contracts were used as a hedge
of sales to retail customers, the hypothetical adverse movement in wholesale
electricity prices is offset by increased retail margin; therefore, the
previously reported hypothetical loss for December 31, 2000 of $406 million has
been restated. The decrease in the hypothetical loss for Europe from 2000 also
reflects the decrease in energy purchase commitments in 2001.

   TRADING OPERATIONS -- For financial reporting purposes, trading operations
are defined as those activities with the objective of generating profits on or
from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices on the purchase and/or sale
of electricity, natural gas, fuel and other energy-related products. For TXU
Corp. and its subsidiaries this consists of the non-regulated energy trading
subsidiaries which trade electricity, natural gas, fuel and other
energy-related products as a commodity. TXU Corp. uses mark-to-market
accounting for energy trading operations (see Note 2 to Financial Statement).

   The contractual agreements and derivatives held by the energy trading
operations are exposed to losses in fair value due to changes in the price and
volatility of the underlying commodities.

                                     C-31

<PAGE>

   VAR -- The quantification of market risk using value-at-risk methodologies
provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and
products. The use of this method requires a number of key assumptions, such as
use of (i) a 95% confidence level; (ii) an estimated one- to five-day holding
period, depending on the commodity and duration of the position (this is the
time needed to liquidate different commodity and term positions); and (iii)
historical estimates of volatility or other simulation based volatility
estimates (such as the Monte Carlo simulation). The standard deviation used in
the different regions varies as a result of the volatility in the respective
markets.

   At December 31, 2001, the total VAR for TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries
relating to energy trading activities was $32 million, based on a 95%
confidence level and a one-day holding period. Comparable information on a VAR
basis is not available for the full year of 2000. Therefore, a measure of
market risk using the sensitivity analysis method is provided herein for 2000
and 2001 which measures the potential loss in earnings based on a hypothetical
percentage movement in energy prices.

   The hypothetical loss in fair value, arising from an adverse movement in
future prices of at least 10%, of TXU Corp.'s derivatives and other contracts
entered into for trading purposes in existence at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
using standard sensitivity analysis techniques, was:

   INTEREST RATE RISK

   The table below provides information concerning TXU Corp.'s financial
instruments as of December 31, 2001 that are sensitive to changes in interest
rates. TXU Corp. has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed
to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and variable-rate interest
amounts calculated with reference to specified notional principal amounts at
dates that generally coincide with interest payments. For trust securities, the
table presents cash flows based on December 31, 2001 book values and the
related weighted average rates by expected redemption date. Weighted average
variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date. Capital
leases and the effects of fair value hedges on long-term debt are excluded from
the table. In addition, $1.1 billion of long-term debt of TXU Europe assumed in
January 2002 by the LE Group in connection with the sale of the UK networks
business has been excluded herein.

   FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

   TXU Corp. has exposure to foreign currency risks, primarily with the British
pound sterling and the Australian dollar. TXU Europe and TXU Australia have
accessed the US capital markets and issued dollar denominated obligations. TXU
Corp. and its subsidiaries enter into currency swaps, options and forwards,
where appropriate, to manage foreign currency exposure. The following table
summarizes notional amounts at the contract exchange rates, weighted-average
contractual exchange rates and estimated fair value by contract maturity for
open contracts at December 31, 2001 and 2000:

   CREDIT RISK

   TXU Corp.'s gross exposure to credit risk represents trade accounts
receivable, energy trading assets and derivative assets. (See Note 17 to
Financial Statements.)

   The largest share of the gross assets subject to credit risk are accounts
receivable from the retail sale of electricity and gas to millions of
residential and small commercial customers. The risk of material loss from
nonperformance from these customers is not considered likely. Reserves for
uncollectible accounts receivable are provided for the potential loss from
nonpayment by these customers based on historical experience. The restructuring
of the electric industry in Texas effective January 1, 2002 increases the risk
profile of TXU Energy in relation to its customers; however, TXU Energy has the
ability to take actions to mitigate such customer risk.

   Most of the remaining trade accounts receivables are with large commercial
and industrial customers. TXU Corp.'s energy trading counterparties include
major energy companies, financial institutions, gas and electric utilities,
independent power producers, oil and gas producers and other energy trading
companies. The net exposure to credit risk from these counterparties as of
December 31, 2001 is $2,175 million using standardized master netting contracts
and agreements which provide for the right of offset of positive and negative
credit exposures with individual counterparties. Of this amount, approximately
79% of the associated credit exposure is with investment grade counterparties,
as determined using publicly available information including major rating
agencies' published ratings and TXU Corp's internal credit evaluation. Those
counterparties without a Standard & Poor's (S&P) rating of a least BBB- or a
similar rating from another major rating agency, are rated using internal
credit methodologies and credit scoring models to determine an S&P equivalent
rating. Approximately 21% of the credit exposure is considered to be below
investment grade or not rated. TXU Corp. routinely monitors and manages its
exposure to credit risk to these counterparties on this basis.

   In December 2001, as a result of the Enron Corporation bankruptcy, TXU Corp.
considered its global exposure and, taking into consideration netting
agreements, recorded a $22 million after-tax charge related to TXU Europe's
exposure to Enron.

   TXU Corp. had no exposure to any one customer that represented greater than
5% of the gross fair value of TXU Corp.'s trade accounts receivable, energy
trading assets and derivative assets at December 31, 2001. Based on TXU Corp.'s
policies for managing credit risk, its exposures and its

                                     C-34

<PAGE>

credit and other reserves, TXU Corp. does not anticipate a materially adverse
effect on its financial position or results of operations as a result of
non-performance by any counterparty.

REGULATION AND RATES

   TXU Gas Distribution employs a continuing program of rate review for all
classes of customers in its regulatory jurisdictions. Rate relief amounting to
$26.8 million in annualized revenue increases, exclusive of changes in gas
costs, was granted in 2001 in addition to $19.8 million granted in 2000 and
$7.5 million granted in 1999. On March 1, 2002, TXU Gas Distribution filed rate
cases in 111 North Texas cities, including the city of Dallas, supporting $53
million in annualized revenue increases. Weather normalization adjustment
clauses, which allow rates to be adjusted to reflect warmer- or
colder-than-normal weather during the winter months, have been approved by 419
cities served by TXU Gas Distribution. TXU Gas Distribution has filed
applications to terminate these adjustments, but cannot predict the outcome of
these proceedings.

   Although the price of natural gas fluctuated significantly in 2001, the city
gate rate for the cost of gas TXU Gas Distribution ultimately delivers to
residential and commercial customers is established by the Railroad Commission
of Texas (RRC )and provides for full recovery of the actual cost of gas
delivered.

   TXU Gas Distribution filed gas cost reconciliations covering periods between
November 1997 and June 30, 2001 with the RRC. As part of this filing, TXU Gas
Distribution is seeking to recover $31.3 million of under-recovered gas costs.

   US Holdings and certain other regulated subsidiaries of TXU Corp. have
several rate requests or refunds pending or on appeal, see Note 4 to Financial
Statements.

   Europe -- Electricity retail price controls in the UK became effective on
April 1, 2000. The directly controlled tariffs were reduced by an average of
7.1% from April 1, 2000 as required by the new controls. It is expected that
price restraints will no longer be applied to domestic customers. The Director
of Gas and Electricity Supply has indicated that he hopes to be able to remove
price controls effective April 1, 2002.

   Australia -- On September 21, 2000, the Office of the Regulator General
published its final decision in the 2001 Electricity Distribution Price Review.
TXU Australia's electricity distribution tariffs effective from January 1, 2001
until at least December 31, 2005 was redetermined on December 1, 2000.

   The Australian government has the power to regulate retail prices for
electricity customers with a usage below 160 MWh/year until 2003. TXU Australia
and other Victorian retailers have submitted to the government their proposals
for price increases. The government has used its reserve powers to regulate
retail prices and has approved a price increase for TXU Australia to take
effect January 13, 2002. As of January 13, 2002, all customers have the option
to choose their retailer. Based on information available from the experience of
mass-market competition in other industries and other countries, TXU Australia
expects that the competition will be less intense for these smaller customers.

   The distribution tariffs applying to TXU Networks (Gas) are effective until
December 31, 2002, when a new determination of the tariffs for the following
five-year period can be made.

   Summary -- Although TXU Corp. cannot predict future regulatory or
legislative actions or any changes in economic and securities market
conditions, no changes are expected in trends or commitments, other than those
discussed in this report, which might significantly alter its basic financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

   On January 1, 2001, TXU Corp. adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended by SFAS No. 137 and
SFAS No. 138. (See Note 3 to Financial Statements.)

   SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities", became effective for TXU Corp. for
transfers on or after April 1, 2001. SFAS No. 140 revises the standards for
accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral and requires additional disclosures in its financial statements.
These disclosures have been incorporated in the accompanying financial
statements.

   SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", became effective for TXU Corp. on
July 1, 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires the use of the purchase method of
accounting for business combinations initiated and completed after June 30,
2001 and eliminates the use of the pooling-of-interests method.

   SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", became effective for
TXU Corp. on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires, among other things, the
allocation of goodwill to reporting units based upon the current fair value of
the reporting units and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization.

   In addition, SFAS No. 142 requires completion of a transitional goodwill
impairment test within six months from the date of adoption. It establishes a
new method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an
interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Any goodwill
impairment loss during the transition period will be recognized as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Subsequent impairments
will be recorded in operations.

   As part of its implementation effort to adopt SFAS No. 142, TXU Corp. is in
the process of determining its reporting units as defined by SFAS No. 142, the
fair value of those reporting units and the allocation of goodwill to those
reporting units.

   SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", will be
effective for TXU Corp. on January 1, 2003. Among other matters, SFAS No. 143
requires the recognition of a fair value liability for any retirement
obligation associated with long-lived assets. The offset to any liability
recorded is added to the previously recorded asset and the additional amount is
depreciated over the same period as the long-lived asset for which the
retirement obligation is established. TXU Corp. will change its accounting for
nuclear decommissioning costs to conform to the new standard.

   SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets", became effective for TXU Corp. on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144
establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", for long-lived assets to be disposed of
by sale and resolves significant implementation issues related to SFAS No. 121.

   For standards not yet adopted, TXU Corp. is evaluating the potential impact
on its financial position and results of operations.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

   This report and other presentations made by TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries
(collectively, TXU Corp.) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Although TXU
Corp. believes that in making any such statement its expectations are based on
reasonable assumptions, any such statement involves uncertainties and

                                     C-36

<PAGE>

is qualified in its entirety by reference to the following important factors,
among others, that could cause the actual results of TXU Corp. to differ
materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements: (i)
prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Commission, the Railroad Commission
of Texas, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Office of the Regulator
General of Victoria, Australia, and the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets
covering England, Wales and Scotland in the UK with respect to approval of the
regulatory settlement plan, allowed rates of return, industry and rate
structure, purchased power and investment recovery, operations of nuclear
generating facilities, acquisitions and disposal of assets and facilities,
operation and construction of plant facilities, decommissioning costs, present
or prospective wholesale and retail competition, changes in tax laws and
policies and changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and
policies, (ii) weather conditions and other natural phenomena, (iii)
unanticipated population growth or decline, and changes in market demand and
demographic patterns, (iv) competition for retail and wholesale customers, (v)
pricing and transportation of crude oil, natural gas and other commodities,
(vi) unanticipated changes in interest rates, commodity prices, rates of
inflation or foreign exchange rates, (vii) unanticipated changes in operating
expenses and capital expenditures, (viii) commercial bank market and capital
market conditions, (ix) competition for new energy development opportunities,
(x) legal and administrative proceedings and settlements, (xi) inability of the
various counterparties to meet their obligations with respect to TXU Corp.'s
financial instruments, (xii) changes in technology used and services offered by
TXU Corp., and (xiii) significant changes in TXU Corp.'s relationship with its
employees and the potential adverse effects if labor disputes or grievances
were to occur.

   Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such
statement is made, and TXU Corp. undertakes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on
which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for TXU
Corp. to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such
factor or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause
results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statement.

                          TXU CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                          STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY

   The management of TXU Corp. is responsible for the preparation, integrity
and objectivity of the consolidated financial statements of TXU Corp. and its
subsidiaries and other information included in this report. The consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As appropriate,
the statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of
management.

   The management of TXU Corp. has established and maintains a system of
internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, on a cost-effective
basis, that assets are safeguarded, transactions are executed in accordance
with management's authorization and financial records are reliable for
preparing consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the
system of control provides reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities
that could be material to the consolidated financial statements are prevented
or would be detected within a timely period. Key elements in this system
include the effective communication of established written policies and
procedures, selection and training of qualified personnel and organizational
arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility. This
system of control is augmented by an ongoing internal audit program designed to
evaluate its adequacy and effectiveness. Management considers the
recommendations of the internal auditors and independent auditors concerning
TXU Corp.'s system of internal control and takes appropriate actions which are
cost-effective in the circumstances. Management believes that, as of December
31, 2001, TXU Corp.'s system of internal control was adequate to accomplish the
objectives discussed herein.

   The Board of Directors of TXU Corp. addresses its oversight responsibility
for the consolidated financial statements through its Audit Committee, which is
composed of directors who are not employees of TXU Corp. The Audit Committee
meets regularly with TXU Corp.'s management, internal auditors and independent
auditors to review matters relating to financial reporting, auditing and
internal control. To ensure auditor independence, both the internal auditors
and independent auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee.

   The independent auditing firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP is engaged to audit,
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America, the consolidated financial statements of TXU Corp. and its
subsidiaries and to issue their report thereon.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TXU Corp.:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TXU Corp.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements
of consolidated income, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders'
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These
financial statements are the responsibility of TXU Corp.'s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of TXU Corp. and subsidiaries at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

                          TXU CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   BUSINESS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

   TXU Corp. is a global energy services company and engages in electricity
generation, wholesale energy trading, retail energy marketing, energy delivery,
other energy-related services and, through a joint venture, telecommunications
services. TXU Corp. is a holding company whose principal United States (US)
operations are conducted through TXU US Holdings Company (US Holdings),
formerly TXU Electric Company and TXU Gas Company (TXU Gas). TXU Corp.'s
principal international operations are conducted through TXU International
Holdings Limited (TXU International Holdings), which in turn indirectly owns
TXU Europe Limited (TXU Europe) and TXU Australia Holdings (Partnership)
Limited Partnership (TXU Australia).

   Business Restructuring -- Legislation was passed during the 1999 session of
the Texas Legislature that restructures the electric utility industry in Texas
(1999 Restructuring Legislation). Among other matters, the l999 Restructuring
Legislation provides that by January 1, 2002, each electric utility was
required to separate (unbundle) its business into the following: power
generation operations, a retail electric provider (REP) and a transmission and
distribution (T&D) company or separate T&D companies. As a result, TXU Corp.
restructured certain of its businesses effective January 1, 2002. (See Note 4
for detailed information concerning restructuring of the electric utility
industry in Texas.)

   As required by the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, US Holdings filed its
business separation plan with the Public Utility Commission of Texas
(Commission). This business separation plan and the March 2000 application to
the Commission laid the foundation for US Holdings to take part in retail
competition in the Texas electricity market as planned on January 1, 2002. In
order to satisfy its obligations to unbundle its business pursuant to the 1999
Restructuring Legislation and consistent with its business separation plan as
amended and approved by the Commission on October 31, 2001, as of January 1,
2002 US Holdings transferred:

  .  its electric T&D assets to TXU Electric Delivery Company (renamed Oncor
     Electric Delivery Company effective January 17, 2002) (Oncor), which is a
     utility regulated by the Commission and a wholly-owned subsidiary of US
     Holdings,

  .  its electric power generation assets to subsidiaries of TXU Energy Company
     LLC (TXU Energy), which is the new competitive business and a wholly-owned
     subsidiary of US Holdings and

  .  its retail customers to a subsidiary REP of TXU Energy.

   The T&D assets of TXU SESCO Company, a subsidiary of TXU Corp., were also
transferred to Oncor. In addition, as of January 1, 2002, US Holdings acquired
the following businesses from within the TXU system and transferred them to TXU
Energy: the REP of TXU SESCO Company LLC; the energy trading business and the
unregulated commercial/industrial retail gas operations of TXU Gas; and the
energy management services businesses and other affiliates of TXU Corp.,
including the fuel procurement business, TXU Fuel Company, and coal mining
business, TXU Mining Company LP, which service the generation operations.

   The relationships of the entities affected by the restructuring and their
rights and obligations with respect to their collective assets and liabilities
are contractually described in a Master Separation Agreement executed in
December 2001 (Business Separation Agreement).

   Joint Ventures -- In August 2000, TXU Corp. formed a joint venture with
third-party investors and contributed the stock of its telecommunications
subsidiaries, including Fort Bend Communication Company, to Pinnacle One
Partners, L.P. (Pinnacle or the joint venture) for a 50% voting interest and a
distribution of approximately $600 million in cash. The third-party investors
contributed $150 million for the remaining 50% voting interest. No gain or loss
was recorded on the formation of the joint venture. TXU Corp.'s investment in
the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method.

   For the year ended December 31, 2001, Pinnacle reported revenues of $209
million and incurred a net loss of $105 million, due primarily to interest
expense on its senior secured notes. TXU Corp.'s equity in Pinnacle's losses
for the year was $53 million, which is reflected in other income (deductions) -
net. At December 31, 2001 Pinnacle had total assets of approximately $1.1
billion (including goodwill of $336 million) and liabilities of $1.1 billion,
including long-term debt securities of $810 million issued at the time of
Pinnacle's formation.

   In April 2000, TXU Europe and EDF London Investments plc, a subsidiary of
Electricite de France, began operation of an equally-held joint venture named
24seven Utility Services Limited (24seven), for the management, operation and
maintenance of their subsidiaries' respective electricity distribution
networks. TXU Europe accounted for its investment in 24seven by the equity
method of accounting. Employees of the joint venturers' subsidiaries, Eastern
Electricity and London Electricity plc, were transferred to 24seven. In January
2002, TXU Europe sold its interest in 24seven as part of its sale of the UK
electricity distribution (networks) business.

   Dispositions

   On January 18, 2002, TXU Europe completed the sale of its UK networks
business, and its 50% interest in 24seven to London Electricity Group plc (LE
Group) for $1.873 billion, consisting of a cash payment of $801 million and the
assumption by LE Group of $1.072 billion aggregate principal amount of debt.
TXU Europe recorded a loss of $125 million ($88 million after-tax) resulting
from transaction costs on the sale in 2001, which is recorded in other income
(deductions) -- net. The transaction resulted in approximately $1.9 billion of
debt reduction, consisting of $1.072 billion of assumed debt and approximately
$801 million of debt being repaid using the cash proceeds from the sale.

   In December 2001, US Holdings agreed to sell its Handley and Mountain Creek
steam electric generating plants to Exelon Corp., for $443 million in cash. The
Handley plant consists of five natural gas-fueled generating units in Fort
Worth, Texas with a total plant capacity of 1,441 MW. The Mountain Creek plant
in Dallas, Texas consists of five natural gas-fueled generating units with a
total plant capacity of 893 MW. The transaction includes a purchase power and
tolling agreement for TXU Energy Trading to purchase power during summer months
for the next five years. The transaction is expected to be completed in early
2002.

   In December 2001, TXU Europe completed the sale of its 2,000 MW coal-fired
West Burton power station to LE Group for $530 million in cash, including $64
million for operating fuel inventory.

   In October 2001, TXU Europe completed the transfer of its 380 MW
Peterborough and 325 MW King's Lynn gas-fired generating stations in the UK to
Centrica through leasing arrangements. The proceeds from the transfer were $259
million.

   In July 2001, TXU Europe completed the sale of its 1,000 MW coal-fired
Rugeley generating station in the UK to International Power for $280 million.
Cash received at closing was $94 million with the remaining cash proceeds from
the sale received in January 2002.

   In April 2001, TXU Europe received net proceeds of $469 million from the
sale of its 19.2% interest in Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico, SA
(Hidrocantabrico), a Spanish power company, and recorded a pre-tax gain of $73
million. In the year ended December 31, 2000, TXU Europe incurred $11 million
of costs associated with an uncompleted offer to acquire Hidrocantabrico. Both
of these items are recorded in other income (deductions) -- net.

   In February 2001, TXU Europe sold its interest in the North Sea gas fields
for $196 million. From the date of the sale through December 31, 2001, TXU
Europe has received net cash proceeds of $154 million after settlement of
certain outstanding issues, and recorded a net pre-tax gain of $9 million in
other income (deductions) -- net.

   In May 2000, TXU Gas sold substantially all of the assets of its natural gas
processing subsidiary for $105 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $53
million ($34 million after-tax). In May 2000, TXU Europe sold its metering
business in the UK realizing a pretax gain of approximately $44 million
($31 million) after-tax. In addition, in August 2000, TXU Europe completed the
sale of its interest in Severomoravska energetika, a.s. (SME), an Eastern
European power company, for $76 million, realizing a pre-tax gain of
approximately $30 million ($21 million after-tax). All of these sales have been
recorded in other income (deductions) -- net.

   The investments in Hidrocantabrico and SME were previously accounted for as
available-for-sale marketable equity securities, and the amount of holding
gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income were
reclassified as realized gains.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of TXU Corp. and its majority owned subsidiaries, including its business
trusts, and are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (US). All intercompany items and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in businesses
over which TXU Corp. does not maintain effective control, such as the Pinnacle
joint venture, are generally accounted for under the equity method, and the
assets and liabilities of such investees are therefore not reflected in the
consolidated financial statements. The only significant unconsolidated entities
are the Pinnacle joint venture and the companies established to purchase
accounts receivable (see Notes 6 and 15). Certain previously reported amounts
have been reclassified to conform to current classifications. All dollar
amounts in the financial statements and notes to financial statements, except
per share amounts, are stated in millions of US dollars unless otherwise
indicated.

   Use of Estimates -- The preparation of TXU Corp.'s financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that
affect the reporting and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the balance
sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expense, including
mark-to-market valuation adjustments. In the event estimates and/or assumptions
prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent
periods to reflect more current information. No material adjustments, other
than those disclosed elsewhere herein, were made to previous estimates during
the current year.

   System of Accounts -- The accounting records of US Holdings have been
maintained in accordance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC)
Uniform System of Accounts as adopted by the Commission. The regulated
operations of TXU Gas are subject to the accounting requirements prescribed by
the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.

   Regulatory Assets and Liabilities -- The financial statements of TXU Corp.'s
regulated businesses (primarily its US electricity transmission and
distribution and its US gas distribution operations) reflect regulatory assets
and liabilities under cost-based rate regulation in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effect of
Certain Types of Regulation." As a result of the 1999 Restructuring
Legislation, the US electricity generation portion of TXU Corp.'s business no
longer meets the criteria to apply regulatory accounting principles.
Accordingly, application of SFAS No. 71 to the generation portion of the TXU
Corp.'s business was discontinued as of June 30, 1999. Oncor's operations
continue to meet the criteria for recognition of regulatory assets and
liabilities.

   Investments -- TXU Corp. classifies all of its investments in marketable
securities as available for sale. Available for sale securities are generally
carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported in other
comprehensive income (loss). Declines in fair value that are other than
temporary are reflected in other income (deductions) -- net. Deposits in an
external trust fund for nuclear decommissioning are carried at fair value in
the balance sheet in other investments with the changes in fair value recorded
as a liability, to reflect the statutory nature of the trust (see Note 15 -
Nuclear decommissioning).

   Goodwill -- Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over
the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for
each company acquired and was amortized over a range of 20 to 40 years.
Goodwill amortization ceased after December 31, 2001 and is subject to an
impairment-based review procedure. (See Changes in Accounting Standards below.)

   Property, Plant and Equipment -- US electric and gas utility plant is stated
at original cost less certain regulatory disallowances. The cost of
transmission and distribution (T&D) property additions to

                                     C-48

<PAGE>

US electric (and generation property additions prior to July 1, 1999) and gas
utility plant includes labor and materials, applicable overhead and
payroll-related costs and an allowance for funds used during construction.
Generation property additions subsequent to July 1, 1999 and other property,
including non-US property, are stated at cost.

   Interest Capitalized and Allowance For Funds Used During Construction
(AFUDC) -- AFUDC is a cost accounting procedure whereby amounts based upon
interest charges on borrowed funds and a return on equity capital used to
finance construction are added to utility plant being constructed. Prior to
July 1, 1999, AFUDC was capitalized for all expenditures for ongoing
construction work in progress and nuclear fuel in process not otherwise
included in rate base by regulatory authorities. As a result of the 1999
Restructuring Legislation, effective July 1, 1999, recording of AFUDC ceased on
construction work in progress of generation assets and only interest was
capitalized during construction. Interest and AFUDC related to debt for
subsidiaries that still apply SFAS No. 71 are capitalized as a component of
projects under construction and will be amortized over the assets' estimated
useful lives.

   Valuation of Long-Lived Assets -- TXU Corp. evaluates the carrying value of
long-lived assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant
such a review. The carrying value of long-lived assets would be considered
impaired when the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying
value. In that event, a loss would be recognized based on the amount by which
the carrying value exceeds the fair market value. Fair market value is
determined primarily by available market valuations or, if applicable,
discounted cash flows. (See Changes in Accounting Standards below.)

   As a result of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, in 1999, US Holdings
performed an impairment analysis of generation assets under the provisions of
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 121 requires a company to
forecast future net cash flows from operating an asset, on an undiscounted
basis excluding carrying costs, and to compare the sum of those cash flows with
the net carrying value of the asset. Under this test, no impairment existed for
accounting purposes.

   Derivative Instruments -- See Changes in Accounting Standards below for a
discussion of the change in accounting for derivatives that became effective
January 1, 2001 and Note 3 for a more detailed description. TXU Corp. and its
domestic and international subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments,
including options, swaps, futures, forwards and other contractual commitments,
for trading and non-trading purposes in order to manage market risks related to
changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

   The impact of changes in the market value of the effective portion of any
derivative instruments designated and documented as accounting hedges is
deferred in the balance sheet and recognized in earnings when the hedged
transactions are realized, and the ineffective portion is recognized in
earnings.

   Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 133 in January 2001, gains and losses on
non-trading derivative instruments effective as hedges were deferred and
recorded as a component of the underlying transaction when settled. Also, the
energy trading businesses in the US, Europe and Australia used mark-to-market
accounting for their trading activities, which is consistent with the required
accounting under SFAS No. 133 for trading transactions that are derivatives. If
a derivative contract meets the criteria for the normal purchase or sale
exception, TXU Corp. can elect not to treat it as a derivative. The use of the
normal purchase or sale exemption and the hedge accounting designation are
elections that can be made by management if certain strict criteria for
derivatives are met and documented.

   Operating Revenues -- TXU Corp. records revenue for retail and other energy
sales and services under the accrual method. However, the fair market values of
sales contracts determined to be

                                     C-49

<PAGE>

derivative instruments and not designated as normal sales under SFAS No. 133
are recognized upon inception under mark-to-market accounting. Unrealized
mark-to-market valuations are recorded net as revenues. Electricity and gas
sales revenues that are recognized when services are provided to customers on
the basis of periodic cycle meter readings include an estimated accrual for the
value of electricity and gas provided from the meter reading date to the end of
the period. Energy trading revenues are recorded using the mark-to-market
method of accounting.

   The financial statements presented reflect adjustments to revenues in the US
Electric segment for over/under recovered fuel costs. To the extent fuel costs
incurred exceeded regulated fuel factor amounts included in customer billings,
US Electric has recorded revenues on the basis of its ability and intent to
obtain regulatory approval for rate surcharges on future customer billings to
recover such amounts. Conversely, to the extent fuel costs incurred have been
less than amounts included in customer billings, revenues have been reduced on
the basis that US Electric has been required to adjust rates in future customer
billings. Following deregulation of the Texas market, fuel factor amounts will,
if necessary, be applied prospectively; consequently, recorded revenues will no
longer reflect such fuel cost adjustments.

   Mark-to-Market Accounting -- In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) Issue No. 98-10, TXU Corp. accounts for its energy trading activities
using the mark-to-market method of accounting. SFAS No. 133 also requires
mark-to-market accounting for derivatives unless the normal purchase or sale
exception or hedge accounting are elected. Under the mark-to-market method,
energy-related trading contracts and derivative instruments are recorded at
current fair value on the balance sheet as either energy trading assets or
liabilities, and any unrealized gains or losses resulting from period-to-period
changes in the current fair values are recorded net in revenues. TXU Corp.
values its portfolio of energy-related trading contracts, which include
volumetric forecasts, and derivative instruments at current market prices,
commonly referred to as forward price curves. Such market prices normally are
based on independent broker quotes and other trading information and are
validated routinely under TXU Corp.'s risk management control policies. The
availability of quoted market prices is dependent on the type of commodity
(e.g., natural gas, electricity, etc.), time period specified and location of
delivery. In the absence of quoted market prices, forward price curves are
developed based on the available trading information or through the use of
standard accepted modeling techniques based on market fundamentals (e.g.,
supply/demand, replacement cost, etc.).

   All trading positions are marked initially to the mid-point of the bid/ask
spread (the mid-market value) discounted using a risk-free interest rate.
Liquidity valuation adjustments are recorded as reductions of the mid-market
value of open positions and increase as liquidity decreases. In computing the
liquidity valuation adjustments, each market (or curve) is split into liquid
and illiquid portions. The liquid portion varies by region, time period and
commodity. Generally, the liquid period is supported by broker quotes and
frequent trading activity. In illiquid periods, normally little or no market
information exists, and the fair value is generally estimated through market
modeling techniques. However, as a matter of policy, TXU Corp. generally does
not recognize any income or loss from these illiquid periods.

   A performance reserve is also established for costs to complete transactions
and for various administrative and overhead costs associated with settling the
contracts in the future, such as risk management, scheduling and accounting. In
addition, a credit reserve is recorded to allow for the risk that the value of
contracts may not be collected from the counterparties. Mark-to-market
valuation adjustments and reserves (liquidity, performance and credit) are
reflected in TXU Corp.'s balance sheet as a reduction in the value of the
energy trading asset.

   Foreign Currency Translation -- The assets and liabilities of non-US
operations denominated in local currencies are translated at rates in effect at
year end. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the
applicable periods. Generally, local currencies are considered to be the
functional currency, and adjustments resulting from such translation are
included in other comprehensive income (loss).

                                     C-50

<PAGE>

   Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment -- Depreciation of TXU Corp.'s
property, plant and equipment is generally calculated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated service lives of the properties. Depreciation also includes
an amount for decommissioning costs for US Holdings' nuclear powered electric
generating station (Comanche Peak), which is being accrued over the lives of
the units. Consolidated depreciation as a percent of average depreciable
property for TXU Corp. approximated 3.1% for 2001, 3.2% for 2000 and 3.6% for
1999.

   Amortization of Nuclear Fuel -- The amortization of nuclear fuel in the
reactors (net of regulatory disallowances) is calculated on the
units-of-production method and is included in nuclear fuel expense.

   Income Taxes -- TXU Corp. and its US subsidiaries file a consolidated
federal income tax return, and federal income taxes are allocated to
subsidiaries based upon their respective taxable income or loss. Investment tax
credits are amortized to income over the estimated service lives of the
properties. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences
between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Certain provisions of
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", provide that regulated enterprises
are permitted to recognize deferred taxes as regulatory tax assets or tax
liabilities if it is probable that such amounts will be recovered from, or
returned to, customers in future rates.

   Income Taxes on Undistributed Earnings of Non-US Subsidiaries -- TXU Corp.
intends to reinvest the earnings of its non-US subsidiaries into those
businesses. Accordingly, no provision has been made for taxes which would be
payable if such earnings were to be repatriated. Upon distribution of these
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, TXU Corp. may be subject to US
income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not practicable, however, to
estimate the amount of taxes that may be payable on the eventual remittance of
these earnings.

   Gains/Losses on Extinguishments of Debt -- Gains and losses on reacquired
debt are recognized in the Statement of Income as incurred in accordance with
SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt ", unless
these costs will be recovered from customers through regulated cash flows. In
that case, these gains or losses are deferred and recorded as a regulatory
asset and amortized to interest expense over the period approved for ratemaking
purposes.

   Earnings Per Share -- Basic earnings per share applicable to common stock
are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year. Diluted earnings per share include the effect of potential common
shares resulting from the assumed exercise of all outstanding stock options and
settlement of forward stock purchase agreements. For the years ended December
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999; 235,449: 447,827 and 193,194 shares, respectively,
were added to the average shares outstanding.

   Additional dilution of earnings per share would result for common stock
associated with 7,089,898 shares of common stock in connection with
equity-linked debt securities issued in 1998 if the strike price of $49.19 per
share falls below the average market price for the period. Additional dilution
of earnings per share would result for common stock associated with 17,960,000
shares of common stock of equity-linked debt securities issued in 2001 if the
strike price of $55.68 per share falls below the average market price for the
period.

   Cash Equivalents -- For purposes of reporting cash and cash equivalents,
temporary cash investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months
or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

   Changes in Accounting Standards -- On January 1, 2001, TXU Corp. adopted
SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities",
as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. (See Note 3 to Financial
Statements.)

                                     C-51

<PAGE>

   SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities", became effective for TXU Corp. for
transfers on or after April 1, 2001. SFAS No. 140 revises the standards for
accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral and requires additional disclosures, which have been incorporated in
the financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 140 did not affect reported
results.

   SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations", became effective for TXU Corp. on
July 1, 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires the use of the purchase method of
accounting for business combinations initiated and completed after June 30,
2001 and eliminates the use of the pooling-of-interests method.

   SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", became effective for
TXU Corp. on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires, among other things, the
allocation of goodwill to reporting units based upon the current fair value of
the reporting units and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. The
amortization of TXU Corp.'s existing goodwill ($220 million annually) ceased
effective January 1, 2002.

   In addition, SFAS No. 142 requires completion of a transitional goodwill
impairment test within six months from the date of adoption. It establishes a
new method of testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an
interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Any goodwill
impairment loss during the transition period will be recognized as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Subsequent impairments
will be recorded in operations.

   As part of its implementation effort to adopt SFAS No. 142, TXU Corp. is in
the process of determining its reporting units as defined by SFAS No. 142, the
fair value of those reporting units and the allocation of goodwill to those
reporting units.

   SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations", will be
effective for TXU Corp. on January 1, 2003. SFAS No. 143 requires the
recognition of a fair value liability for any retirement obligation associated
with long-lived assets. The offset to any liability recorded is added to the
previously recorded asset and the additional amount is depreciated over the
same period as the long-lived asset for which the retirement obligation is
established. SFAS No. 143 also requires additional disclosures. TXU Corp. will
change its accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs to conform to the new
standard.

   SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets", became effective for TXU Corp. on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144
establishes a single accounting model, based on the framework established in
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of ", for long-lived assets to be disposed of
by sale and resolves significant implementation issues related to SFAS No. 121.

   For standards not yet adopted, TXU Corp. is evaluating the potential impact
on its financial position and results of operations.

3.  ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

   SFAS No. 133 became effective for TXU Corp. on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. It requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance
sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings, unless (i) the normal
purchase or sale exception or (ii) hedge accounting is elected.

                                     C-52

<PAGE>

   TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments, including
options, swaps, futures, forwards and other contractual commitments for both
non-trading and trading purposes. TXU Corp. and its domestic and international
subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments for non-trading purposes in
order to manage market risks related to changes in interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and commodity prices.

   TXU Corp. has designated, documented and assessed accounting hedge
relationships which mostly resulted in cash-flow hedges that require TXU Corp.
to record the derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on its
balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income. Hedge
ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings. Amounts are removed from other
comprehensive income as the underlying transactions occur.

   TXU Corp. utilizes treasury derivative instruments (i.e., interest rate
swaps, cross currency swaps, etc.) in order to manage its exposures to changes
in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. TXU Corp. generally
designates and uses hedge accounting for these treasury instruments.

   TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries have numerous investments in foreign
subsidiaries, and the net assets and earnings of these subsidiaries are exposed
to currency exchange-rate volatility. TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries have not
entered into derivative transactions to hedge their material net investments in
foreign operations, but subsidiaries have used foreign currency-denominated
debt as the hedge. TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries enter into currency swaps,
options and forwards, where appropriate, to manage foreign currency exposure.

   TXU Corp. enters into physical and financial contracts to hedge market risks
and exposures to prices of electricity, natural gas and fuel utilized for its
generation assets and certain forecasted purchases and sales of power. TXU
Corp. uses hedge accounting for these non-trading commodity transactions.

   In 2001 TXU Corp. began entering into contracts with large commercial and
industrial customers for electricity deliveries following deregulation of the
electricity markets in Texas which began January 1, 2002. The contracts for
such deliveries are derivatives; accordingly, these contracts were accounted
for on the mark-to-market accounting method in 2001. Due to the highly
competitive nature of the large US commercial and industrial customer base, TXU
Corp. manages these commodity sales contracts through its energy trading
operations. Due to the nature of these contracts, unrealized gains of $88
million were recognized on origination pursuant to SFAS No. 133, and have been
included with energy trading assets. An additional $38 million in origination
gains were recorded in 2001 primarily related to commercial and industrial
retail contracts for sales of natural gas, but $31 million in gains were
realized within the year, as the majority of the contracts are short-lived.

   Financial Summary -- TXU Corp. formally documents all relationships between
accounting hedge instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management
objective and strategy for undertaking various accounting hedge transactions.
This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as
fair-value, cash-flow or foreign-currency hedges to specific assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted
transactions. The maximum term over which TXU Corp. hedges its exposure to the
variability of future cash flows (for all forecasted transactions, excluding
interest payments on variable-rate debt) is six years.

   In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No. 133, TXU Corp.
recorded, as of January 1, 2001, a cumulative effect of $132 million after-tax
as a decrease to other comprehensive income to recognize the fair value of all
derivatives effective as cash-flow hedging instruments, mostly related to
derivatives of TXU Europe. For the period from transition to December 31, 2001,
$193 million of net losses were reclassified into earnings, substantially all
of which related to the cumulative net losses at transition plus the related
changes in fair value up to the dates of reversal.

                                     C-53

<PAGE>

   Essentially all of the terms of TXU Corp.'s derivatives which have been
designated as accounting hedges match the terms of the underlying hedged items.
TXU Corp. experienced net hedge ineffectiveness of $3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2001. This amount was reported as interest expense ($1
million) and as a gain in revenues ($4 million) and represented the total
ineffectiveness of all cash-flow hedges.

   With the implementation of the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA)
in the UK in March 2001, most of TXU Europe's derivative contracts used to
hedge exposure to changes in Pool prices were renegotiated into bilateral
contracts. Prior to NETA, these contracts, had been designated as cash flow
hedges. The renegotiated bilateral contracts qualify as a normal purchase
contracts. In April 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
finalized a conclusion that contracts with volume optionality do not qualify
for the normal purchase or sale exception. As a result, certain of TXU Europe's
gas option contracts have been accounted for as derivatives since July 1, 2001
in accordance with the transition provisions of such revised guidance,
resulting in a net charge of $5 million as a cumulative effect of this change
recorded in other income (deductions) -- net.

   Subsequently, the FASB approved a number of implementation issues regarding
the normal purchase or sale exception. One of the issues applied exclusively to
the electric industry and provided for the normal purchase or sale exception
under specific circumstances. Under the new guidance, certain of TXU Europe's
electricity contracts qualify for the normal purchase or sale exception from
July 1, 2001, thus removing them from SFAS No. 133 classification as
derivatives.

   As of December 31, 2001, it is expected that $45 million after-tax of net
losses accumulated in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into
earnings during the next twelve months. This amount represents the projected
value of the hedges over the next twelve months relative to what would be
recorded if the hedge transactions had not been entered into. The amount
expected to be reclassified is not a forecasted loss incremental to normal
operations, but rather it demonstrates the extent to which volatility in
earnings (which would otherwise exist) is mitigated through the use of cash
flow hedges.

   Capacity Auction -- The form of contract entered into as a result of the
capacity auction required by the 1999 Restructuring Legislation is a derivative
pursuant to SFAS No. 133. These contracts have not been designated as
accounting hedges and did not have significant mark-to-market value at December
31, 2001.

4.  RESTRUCTURING OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY IN TEXAS

   1999 Restructuring Legislation -- Legislation passed during the 1999 session
of the Texas Legislature restructured the electric utility industry in Texas
and provided for a transition to competition. Among other matters with
accounting consequences, the legislation:

  .  provided that by January 1, 2002, each electric utility had to separate
     (unbundle) its business into the following units: a power generation
     company, a retail electric provider (REP) and a transmission and
     distribution (T&D) company or separate T&D companies;

  .  authorized competition beginning January 1, 2002 in the retail and
     generation markets for electricity;

  .  provides for the recovery of generation-related regulatory assets and
     generation-related and purchased power-related costs that are in excess of
     market value (stranded costs);*

  .  provides for a "true up" in 2004 of stranded costs based on market
     determinations;*

                                     C-54

<PAGE>

  .  required a rate freeze, excluding cost of fuel, for all retail customers
     until January 1, 2002 and requires certain rate reductions and a price to
     beat for residential and small commercial customers for up to five years
     thereafter;

  .  provided that earnings in excess of a regulatory earnings cap be used as
     mitigation (reduction) to the cost of nuclear production assets;*

  .  provides that wholesale revenues for 2002 and 2003 be based on the Excess
     Cost Over Market (ECOM) model*;

  .  provides for a reduction in T&D rates (as a retail clawback) in certain
     circumstances described below; *

  .  provides that costs associated with nuclear decommissioning obligations
     continue to be recovered from retail customers as a non-bypassable charge
     until the units are decommissioned.
- --------
* The application of these provisions to TXU Corp. will change in the event the
  settlement plan proposed to the Commission is approved. See Regulatory
  Settlement Plan below.

   Regulatory Settlement Plan -- On December 31, 2001, US Holdings filed a
settlement plan with the Commission that, if approved, will resolve all major
pending issues related to US Holdings' transition to competition and will
supersede certain ongoing proceedings discussed below that are related to the
1999 Restructuring Legislation. The settlement plan has the endorsement of the
major customer groups in the State of Texas. Parties to the settlement include
the Commission staff, the Office of Public Utility Counsel, the coalition of
cities served by Oncor, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers, Texas Retailers
Association, and a new retail electric provider for the state. The settlement,
does not remove regulatory oversight of Oncor's business nor does it eliminate
TXU Energy's price-to-beat rates and related possible fuel adjustments
described below. The settlement must be approved by the Commission, which has
held a hearing on it and is awaiting briefs from the parties. US Holdings is
unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings.

   Among other things, the settlement plan resolves T&D rates, the true-up in
2004 of stranded costs, securitization of regulatory assets, collection of
current unrecovered fuel costs, reconciliation of 31/2 years of fuel expenses
and the retail and wholesale clawbacks.

   The major terms of the settlement plan are:

  .  Transmission and Distribution Rates -- In 2002, Oncor will implement an
     excess mitigation credit (EMC) in the amount of $350 million (plus
     interest), applied over a two-year period as a reduction to T&D rates
     charged to REPs. This amount reflects resolution of stranded cost
     mitigation, approximately $8.2 billion of fuel costs covering the period
     of July 1998 through 2001, the unrecovered fuel balance at December 31,
     2001, and other items.

  .  Stranded Cost Resolution -- TXU Energy's stranded costs are fixed at zero,
     including resolution of amounts related to its repurchase of minority
     owner interests in the Comanche Peak nuclear generating station, recovery
     of certain environmental improvement costs and elimination of the 2004
     true-up proceedings.

  .  Regulatory Asset Securitization -- Oncor will receive a financing order
     authorizing it to issue securitization bonds in the aggregate amount of
     $1.3 billion to recover generation-related regulatory assets. The
     settlement provides that there will be an initial issuance of
     securitization bonds in the amount of up to $500 million upon approval of
     the settlement followed by a second issuance for the remainder after 2003.
     This settlement resolves all issues related to generation - related
     regulatory assets and liabilities.

                                     C-55

<PAGE>

  .  Retail Clawback -- The retail clawback provision was included in the 1999
     Restructuring Legislation to serve as an incentive for the affiliated REP
     of the utilities to actively compete for customers outside their
     traditional service areas. In the event that TXU Energy's affiliated REP
     retains more than 60 percent of its residential and small commercial
     customers after the first two years of competition, the amount of the
     retail clawback credit will be equal to:

    .  the number of residential and small commercial customers retained by TXU
       Energy in its traditional service area on January 1, 2004;

    .  less the number of new customers TXU Energy adds outside of its
       traditional service territory by January 1, 2004;

    .  multiplied by $90.

  .  This determination will be made separately for the residential and small
     commercial classes and compares to the $150 per customer limit contained
     in the 1999 Restructuring Legislation. The credit will be applied to
     Oncor's rates over a two-year period beginning January 1, 2004.

  .  Lawsuit and Regulatory Proceeding Resolution -- The parties agree to seek
     dismissal of a number of currently pending and planned lawsuits, as well
     as regulatory proceedings, including Docket No. 22652. (See Regulatory
     Disallowances.)

   TXU Corp. recorded a $154 million (after-tax) extraordinary charge in the
fourth quarter of 2001 as a result of settlement related items and debt
refinancing. (See Note 5.)

Implementation of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation

   As noted in the appropriate sections of the following discussion, the
settlement plan filed with the Commission by US Holdings, if adopted, will
result in final determination concerning certain provisions of the legislation.

   If the settlement plan is not approved, certain other proceedings discussed
below will not be resolved.

   Stranded Cost True-up (see Regulatory Settlement Plan above) -- The 1999
Restructuring Legislation requires each T&D utility, its affiliated REP, and
its affiliated power generation company to jointly file to finalize stranded
costs and to reconcile those costs with the estimate of stranded costs
developed in the unbundled cost of service proceeding conducted during
2000-2001, such as US Holdings' Docket No. 22350. Such a true-up proceeding
will be filed after January 10, 2004, on a schedule and under procedures to be
determined by the Commission. Any resulting stranded costs will be collected
for TXU Energy through the non-bypassable delivery charges of Oncor, unless the
regulatory settlement plan described above is approved, in which case, this
filing is not required.

   For the purposes of determining the final stranded cost figure, the 1999
Restructuring Legislation requires TXU Energy to quantify the market value of
its generation assets, and hence its stranded costs, using one or more of the
following methods: (i) sale of assets, (ii) stock valuation, (iii) partial
stock valuation, (iv) exchange of assets or (v) ECOM.

   Any true-up proceeding would also require:

  .  TXU Energy to reconcile, and either credit or bill to Oncor (and Oncor to
     credit or bill T&D customers), any difference between the price of power
     determined through the capacity auction process conducted pursuant to the
     Commission's requirements and the power cost projections that were
     employed for the same time period in the ECOM model to estimate stranded
     costs in

                                     C-56

<PAGE>

     the Docket No. 22350 proceeding. This reconciliation (wholesale clawback)
     generally would affect all of TXU Energy's generation revenues for the
     period 2002-2003.

  .  TXU Energy to reconcile and credit to Oncor (and Oncor to credit T&D
     customers) any positive difference between the price to beat, reduced by
     the non-bypassable delivery charge, and the prevailing market price of
     electricity during the same time period to the extent that the price to
     beat exceeded the market price of electricity. This reconciliation (retail
     clawback) for the applicable customer class is not required if 40% of the
     electric power consumed by customers in that class is supplied by
     competing REPs before January 1, 2004. If a reconciliation is required,
     the amount credited cannot exceed an amount equal to the number of
     residential or small commercial customers served by Oncor that are buying
     electricity from TXU Energy at the price to beat on January 1, 2004, minus
     the number of new customers obtained outside the service area, multiplied
     by $150; and

  .  the Commission to conduct a review, to the extent any amount of regulatory
     assets included in a transition charge or competition transition charge
     had not been previously approved by the Commission, to determine whether
     these regulatory assets were appropriately calculated and constituted
     reasonable and necessary costs. If the Commission finds that the amount of
     regulatory assets is subject to modification, a credit or other rate
     adjustment will be made to Oncor's non-bypassable delivery rates.

   Stranded Cost Recovery (see Regulatory Settlement Plan above) -- In October
1999, US Holdings filed an application with the Commission for a financing
order (Docket No. 21527) to permit the issuance by a special purpose entity of
$1.65 billion of transition bonds secured by payments in the form of a
non-bypassable charge from retail customers. On May 1, 2000, the Commission
signed a final order rejecting US Holdings' request for the $1.65 billion and
authorized only $363 million. US Holdings filed an appeal on May 2, 2000, with
the Travis County, Texas District Court. On September 7, 2000, the District
Court issued a final judgment that reversed part of the Commission's financing
order, affirmed other aspects of the Commission's financing order, and ordered
the case remanded to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with the
judgment. US Holdings and various other parties appealed this judgment directly
to the Supreme Court of Texas. On June 6, 2001, the Supreme Court of Texas
issued what US Holdings believes is a favorable ruling that should allow Oncor
to issue transition bonds of approximately $1.3 billion. On October 18, 2001,
the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Commission for determination of the
final amount of permitted securitization. The Commission has begun the remand
proceeding (Docket No. 24892). US Holdings cannot predict when it will be
completed, but is prepared to move quickly in connection with the issuance of
transition bonds once a final financing order is issued by the Commission. In
connection with the Regulatory Settlement Plan described above, Docket No.
24892 has been consolidated into that proceeding and Docket No. 24892 has been
closed.

   On June 6, 2001, the Texas Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Travis
County, Texas District Court denying an appeal and finding that the
securitization provisions are constitutional.

   Mitigation (see Regulatory Settlement Plan above) -- From January 1, 1998
through June 30, 1999, earnings of $170 million in 1998 and $52 million in 1999
in excess of the regulatory earnings cap (mitigation) were recorded as
additional depreciation of nuclear production assets. Effective July 1, 1999,
following the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, all of US Holdings' and TXU SESCO
Company's earnings in excess of the regulatory earnings cap of $92 million in
1999, $310 million in 2000 and $40 million in 2001 were recorded as a reduction
of revenues, with a corresponding regulatory liability recorded.

                                     C-57

<PAGE>

   On June 4, 2001, the Commission issued an interim order that addressed
Oncor's charges for T&D service when retail competition would begin. Among
other things, that interim order and subsequent final order issued on October
3, 2001, required Oncor to reduce rates (which will necessitate a corresponding
reimbursement from TXU Energy), over the period from 2002-2008, both the
1998-2000 earnings in excess of the regulatory earnings cap and an estimate of
the 2001 earnings in excess of the regulatory earnings cap. On June 20, 2001,
US Holdings filed a petition with the Texas Supreme Court, requesting that the
Court issue a writ of mandamus compelling the Commission to vacate the portions
of its orders that require US Holdings to halt mitigation of stranded costs and
reverse the stranded cost mitigation already taken. On December 31, 2001, the
Supreme Court of Texas denied the petition. The Commission's decision continues
to be under appeal to the Travis County, Texas District Court.

   On July 31, 2001, the staff of the Commission notified US Holdings and the
Commission that it disagreed with US Holdings' computation of the level of
earnings in excess of the regulatory earnings cap for calendar year 2000. The
Commission's staff disagrees with US Holdings' adjustment that removed $298
million of deferred federal income tax liability associated with
under-recovered fuel. On August 13, 2001, the Commission issued an order
adopting the staff position. US Holdings disagrees with the Commission's
decision and has appealed it to the Travis County, Texas, District Court. If
the appeal is not successful, TXU Energy will record an after-tax charge of $23
million.

   Fuel Cost Recovery (see Regulatory Settlement Plan above) -- US Holdings'
eligible fuel costs incurred through December 31, 2001 will be recoverable
through fixed fuel factors, and to the extent such costs are not recovered by
that date, through the true-up process. At December 31, 2001, US Holdings had
unrecovered fuel costs plus related interest deferred of $329 million and the
balance, plus additional accrued interest, is expected to be recovered through
the true-up process.

   TXU Energy is required to file in 2002 with the Commission for final
reconciliation of its eligible fuel costs in a proceeding in which it has the
burden of proving that fuel costs under review were reasonable and necessary to
provide reliable electric service, that it has properly accounted for its
fuel-related revenues, and that fuel prices charged to the utility by an
affiliate were reasonable and necessary and not higher than prices charged for
similar items by such affiliate to other affiliates or nonaffiliates. This
final reconciliation will cover the period from July 1998 through December
2001, during which US Holdings incurred about $8.2 billion of reconcilable fuel
costs. Management believes all costs are recoverable; however, should there be
any disallowances by the Commission, these will be the responsibility of TXU
Energy.

   Regulatory Disallowance (see Regulatory Settlement Plan above) -- The
Commission's final order in connection with US Holdings' January 1990 rate
increase request (Docket No. 9300) was ultimately reviewed by the Texas Supreme
Court. As a result, an aggregate of $909 million of disallowances with respect
to US Holdings' reacquisitions of minority owners' interests in Comanche Peak,
which had previously been recorded as a charge to earnings, was remanded to the
District Court with instructions that it be remanded to the Commission for
reconsideration on the basis of a prudent investment standard. On remand, the
Commission also was required to reevaluate the appropriate level of US
Holdings' construction work in progress included in rate base in light of its
financial condition at the time of the initial hearing. On June 9, 2000, the
District Court's order of remand was filed with the Commission, and the
Commission has assigned the remand proceeding Docket No. 22652. A final
decision is expected in 2002.

5.  EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS

   Loss on reacquisition of debt -- As a result of the debt restructuring and
refinancings in the fourth quarter of 2001 TXU Corp. recorded an extraordinary
loss of $97 million (after-taxes of $52 million) for the early reacquisition of
debt related to TXU Energy by US Holdings.

                                     C-58

<PAGE>

   Loss on settlement -- As a result of the Regulatory Settlement Plan
submitted to the Commission for approval of outstanding unbundling issues (see
Note 4 to Financial Statements), TXU Corp. recorded an extraordinary loss of
$57 million (after-taxes of $63 million) in the fourth quarter of 2001 to
reflect the effect of settlement items that are no longer probable of recovery.
The settlement related items include unrecovered fuel cost, all remaining
generation-related regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are not
subject to recovery through the issuance of securitization bonds, and the
excess cost over market of certain purchased power contracts.

6.  SHORT-TERM FINANCING

   At December 31, 2001, TXU Corp. had outstanding short-term borrowings
consisting of commercial paper of $853 million and bank borrowings of $2,369
million. During the years 2001 and 2000, TXU Corp.'s average amounts
outstanding for short-term borrowings were $2,970 million and $3,451 million,
respectively. Weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings were
3.91% and 6.97% at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

   At December 31, 2001, TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries had short-term
facilities available as follows:

(a) US Holdings' borrowings under both facilities are limited to an aggregate
    amount outstanding at any one time of $2 billion. US Credit Agreements
    primarily support commercial paper borrowings of TXU Corp.
(b) At December 31, 2001, letters of credit outstanding under this agreement
    totaled $468 million, which effectively reduces the unused capacity by that
    amount.
(c) Outstanding borrowings were $275 million reflected in short-term notes
    payable-banks and $579 million reflected in long-term debt. The short-term
    borrowing was repaid in January 2002 with proceeds received from a UK plant
    sale.
(d) Tranche C was a bridge facility repaid and cancelled on January 21, 2002 in
    connection with the sale of the UK networks business. (See Note 7).

   Other short-term bank borrowings at December 31, 2001 consisted of TXU
Europe's borrowings under its accounts receivable financing facility that is
collateralized by future receivables of a subsidiary through a short-term note
issue arrangement as noted below; a $45 million Euro term loan-facility with a
commercial bank to fund the investment in Arto Oyj; and various other
short-term borrowings mainly to provide working capital needs.

   Europe -- Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement -- In connection with the
sale of its UK networks business, TXU Europe terminated the Sterling Credit
Agreement, with all borrowings repaid along with associated interest, and
immediately replaced it with a new Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, dated
November 19, 2001. There are three tranches in this facility. Tranche A is a
multi-currency, (Pounds)800 million five-year revolver which allows for
short-term borrowings and the extension to a long- term basis. Tranche B was a
(Pounds)230 million standby facility that was not drawn upon and has been
cancelled. Tranche C was a (Pounds)600 million short-term bridge facility which
was repaid and cancelled in January 2002 upon receipt of proceeds from the UK
networks sale. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding

                                     C-59

<PAGE>

borrowings under this facility were as follows: short-term--Tranche A -
(Pounds)190 million ($275 million) at 4.72% per annum (repaid in January 2002
with proceeds from a plant sale) and Tranche C - (Pounds)560 million ($813
million) at 4.70% per annum (also repaid in January 2002); long-term - Tranche
A - (Pounds)399 million ($579 million) of various currency loans due 2006.

   Sale of Receivables -- TXU Corp., through its subsidiaries, has several
facilities to provide financing through customer accounts receivable. All of
the facilities continually sell customer accounts receivables or undivided
interests therein to financial institutions on an ongoing basis to replace
those receivables that have been collected.

   Prior to January 1, 2002, TXU Gas and US Holdings sold certain customer
accounts receivable to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary of TXU Corp.
(TXU Receivables Company) which sells undivided interests in accounts
receivable it purchases to financial institutions. As of January 1, 2002, the
program was amended to terminate US Holdings' participation and to add TXU
Energy Retail Company LP, TXU SESCO Energy Services Company and Oncor Electric
Delivery Company as qualified originators of accounts receivable under the
program. TXU Receivables Company may sell up to an aggregate of $600 million in
undivided interests in the receivables purchased from the originators under the
program. As of December 31, 2001, TXU Gas had sold $111 million and US Holdings
had sold $812 million face amount of receivables to TXU Receivables Company
under the program in exchange for cash of $500 million and $414 million in
subordinated notes, with $9 million representing costs of the program since
inception in August 2001. Annualized costs of the program approximated 3.7% of
the cash proceeds from the receivables sales. As of December 31, 2000, TXU Gas
had received cash of $100 million and US Holdings had received cash of $500
million for receivables sold under a prior facility. The subordinated notes
receivable from TXU Receivables Company are included in accounts receivable in
the consolidated balance sheet.

   At December 31, 2001, accounts receivable of TXU Europe were reduced by
(Pounds)181 million ($263 million) under a program with a commercial bank, and
(Pounds)108 million ($157 million) of future receivables sold were reflected as
other short-term loans on the balance sheet. The short-term loan amounts bear
interest at an annual rate, which was 4.13% at December 31, 2001, based on
commercial paper rates plus a margin. The program was amended in the third
quarter of 2001 and the overall limit was reduced to (Pounds)300 million.

(a) An interest rate swap effectively fixes the rate on the $400 million series
    of floating rate senior notes maturing in 2003.
(b) Interest rates in effect at December 31, 2001 are presented. These series
    are in a flexible or weekly rate modes and are each secured by an

(c) In 1990, US Holdings purchased the ownership interest in Comanche Peak of
    Tex-La Electric Cooperative of Texas, Inc. (Tex-La) and assumed debt of
    Tex-La payable over approximately 32 years. The assumption is secured by a
    mortgage on the acquired interest.

(d) In July 1998, the interest rate was reset to a fixed rate of 6.56% payable
    until the reset date of January 1, 2005.
(e) TXU Europe has various interest rate and currency swaps in effect with an
    aggregate notional amount of $1.5 billion ((Pounds)921 million) that
    effectively convert fixed rate Senior Notes payable in US dollars to a
    fixed rate debt payable in pounds sterling. These swaps mature on the dates
    of the underlying notes and have a weighted average fixed pay rate of 6.61%
    plus a margin.
(f) The Sterling Credit Agreement facilities were repaid and replaced by the
    Revolving Credit facilities.
(g) At December 31, 2001, TXU Australia had interest rate swaps denominated in
    Australian dollars with an aggregate notional amount of A$2.0 billion ($1.1
    billion) to swap floating rate interest to fixed rates at a weighted
    average fixed rate of 6.70%. In addition, TXU Australia had interest rate
    swaps denominated in US dollars with notional amounts of $250 million
    maturing in 2006 and $100 million maturing in 2016 to swap fixed rate
    interest to floating rates which, was 7.18% at December 31, 2001.
(h) In December 2001, $86 million of senior notes with rates of 10.25% to
    10.58% originally due 2002 to 2010 were reclassified to due currently
    because the company intends to repurchase the notes in 2002.
(i) On October 15, 2001, TXU Corp. exercised its right to redeem the securities.

   Debt Restructure and Refinancing Plan -- On January 1, 2002, US Holdings'
business was restructured into a regulated T&D utility business and an
unregulated energy business. See Note 4 for a more detailed discussion of the
separation of the business. In connection with the restructuring, the
generation assets transferred to TXU Energy were released from the lien of US
Holdings' mortgage. Upon transfer of the T&D assets to Oncor, Oncor assumed US
Holdings' mortgage and the first mortgage bonds outstanding thereunder. The
utility assets of Oncor are subject to the lien of the mortgage.

   Under the debt restructure and refinancing plan, US Holdings' pollution
control bond obligations were assumed by TXU Energy.

   The debt restructuring process resulted in a one-time extraordinary charge
to earnings of $97 million (after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2001. (See Note
5.) In connection with the refinancing, approximately $73 million in additional
losses from the reacquisition of debt and trust securities was allocated to
Oncor and was written-off to operation and maintenance expense in the fourth
quarter of 2001. Because this write-off is recoverable, it reduced the
adjustment to revenues for earnings in excess of the regulatory earnings cap.

   The pollution control series variable rate debt of US Holdings requires
periodic remarketing. Because US Holdings intends to remarket these
obligations, and has the ability and intent to refinance if necessary, they
have been classified as long-term debt.

   Equity-Linked Debt Securities -- In October 2001, TXU Corp. issued a total
of 20 million equity-linked debt securities referred to as 2001 Equity Units
initially consisting of 20 million Corporate Units, each having an initial
stated amount per security of $50. Gross proceeds from the offering were $1.0
billion. Net proceeds were used to repay commercial paper.

   Each Corporate Unit initially consisted of:

      (i) a purchase contract (Purchase Contract) under which the holder is
   obligated to purchase from TXU Corp. by not later than November 16, 2004
   (first settlement date) for $25 cash a specified number of shares of TXU
   Corp.'s common stock (based on a formula using the market price of TXU
   Corp.'s common stock) and is obligated to purchase from TXU Corp. by not
   later than November 16, 2005 (second settlement date) for $25 cash a
   specified number of shares of TXU Corp.'s common stock (based on a formula
   using the market price of TXU Corp.'s common stock),

      (ii) until the first settlement date, both a TXU Corp. Series K Senior
   Note due November 16, 2006 (Series K Note) and a TXU Corp. Series L Senior
   Note due November 16, 2007 (Series L Note and, together with the Series K
   Note, Senior Notes) each having a principal amount of $25, and

      (iii) until the second settlement date, the Series L Senior Note.

   Initially, $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series K Notes and
$500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series L Notes were issued by TXU
Corp. to be held as a component of the

                                     C-62

<PAGE>

Corporate Units. The holder of a Corporate Unit is entitled to receive from TXU
Corp. quarterly payments, in arrears, at 8.75% per annum of the stated amount
of such security ($50) prior to the first settlement date and 8.75% per annum
of the remaining stated amount ($25) from the first settlement date to the
second settlement date. The payments consists of contract adjustment payments
of 3.65% per annum of the stated amount and interest on the Series K Note, at
the rate of 4.75% of $25 per annum, and Series L Note, at the rate of 5.45% of
the $25 per annum, through the first settlement date and 3.30% per annum of the
remaining stated amount and interest on the Series L Note, at the rate of 5.45%
of the $25 per annum, through the second settlement date.

   A holder of Corporate Units may create equity-linked debt securities of the
type called Treasury Units by substituting appropriate treasury securities for
applicable Senior Notes that are components of the Corporate Units. A holder of
Treasury Units may recreate Corporate Units by substituting the appropriate
Senior Notes for the appropriate treasury securities that are components of the
Treasury Units. In each case, the securities replaced by substitution will be
released to the holders.

   Under the terms of the Purchase Contracts, TXU Corp. will issue between
8,980,000 and 10,956,000 shares of its common stock in connection with each
settlement date. A total of 21,912,000 shares of TXU Corp.'s common stock is
reserved for issuance in connection with the 2001 Equity Units.

   In October 2001, TXU Corp. recorded, as a reduction of common stock equity,
the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $116 million and a
portion of the costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2001
Equity Units. A liability was recorded for the contract adjustment payments and
will be reduced as the contract adjustment payments are made. TXU Corp. has the
right to defer the contract adjustment payments, but any such election will
subject TXU Corp. to restrictions on the payment of dividends on and redemption
of outstanding shares of its common stock. TXU Corp. currently has no plans to
defer these contract adjustment payments.

   TXU Corp.'s $700 million of equity-linked debt securities issued in 1998
(1998 Equity Units) consisted of purchase contracts under which the holder
would purchase from TXU Corp. on settlement dates in 2001 and 2002, a number of
its shares of common stock equal to a specified rate (based on a formula using
the market price of TXU Corp.'s common stock) and TXU Corp.'s Series D Senior
Notes due 2003 and TXU Corp.'s Series E Senior Notes due 2004. On August 16,
2001, TXU Corp. issued 7.5 million shares of common stock for $351 million in
fulfillment of stock purchase contracts with holders of these securities. Also,
the coupon rate on the $350 million TXU Corp. Series D Notes due 2003 was reset
from 6.37% to 5.52% commencing August 16, 2001.

   Europe -- EMTN Program -- At December 31, 2001, TXU Europe has a (Euro)2.0
billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) program, under which TXU Europe may from
time to time issue notes in various currencies. As of December 31, 2001, a
financing subsidiary of TXU Europe has (Pounds)301 million ($437 million) of 35
Put 5 Resettable Notes due 2035 (Resettable Notes) outstanding under the EMTN
program. The initial interest rate on the Resettable Notes, up to the first
reset date of November 30, 2005, is 7.7875%. The issuer of the Resettable Notes
has a call option to repurchase the Resettable Notes at par on November 30,
2005. This call option has been assigned to commercial banks for a
consideration of approximately (Pounds)5 million ($7 million) per annum for
five years. The Resettable Notes also include a put option that is exercisable
at 5 years (November 30, 2005) by the holder and a reset feature that permits
the holder to remarket the Resettable Notes at a different interest rate if the
put is not exercised. On the reset date, the new interest rate will be
determined in accordance with the terms of the Resettable Notes for the next 6
to 20 years. The Resettable Notes can be redeemed at principal plus accrued
interest on November 30, 2005.

   As of December 31, 2001, there was (Pounds)275 million ($399 million) in
7.25% Sterling Eurobonds due March 8, 2030 outstanding under the EMTN program.
TXU Europe has granted to the holders an

                                     C-63

<PAGE>

optional put in 2015 in exchange for a waiver of a provision that would have
prohibited the disposition of the UK distribution Networks business. A similar
provision in the Resettable Notes has been waived for a fee without any further
changes to the terms of the Resettable Notes.

   Australia -- In October 2001, TXU Australia refinanced all of its senior
bank debt facilities, maturing from October 2001 to February 2002, into one
syndicated facility. The new facility contains a number of tranches, all of
which will mature in October 2004.

   At December 31, 2001, TXU Australia had A$505 million ($258 million)
medium-term notes outstanding, of which payments of A$475 million ($243
million) were guaranteed under a policy issued by MBIA Insurance Corporation.
The medium-term notes have three tranches consisting of fixed and variable
rates due from October 2003 to September 2007.

   Maturities -- Sinking fund and maturity requirements for the years 2002
through 2006 under all long-term debt instruments in effect at December 31,
2001, were as follows:

   In January 2002, in connection with TXU Europe's sale of its UK distribution
networks business, $1.072 billion of debt ($500 million due 2004, $286 million
due 2012 and $286 million due 2025) was assumed by the LE Group as part of the
sale agreement. This amount was classified as long-term debt on the balance
sheet at December 31, 2001 but has been excluded from the table of maturities
above.

8. TXU CORP. OR SUBSIDIARY OBLIGATED, MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE, PREFERRED
   SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS, EACH HOLDING SOLELY JUNIOR SUBORDINATED
   DEBENTURES OF TXU CORP. OR RELATED SUBSIDIARY (TRUST SECURITIES)

   Statutory business trusts have been established as wholly-owned financing
subsidiaries (Trusts) of TXU Corp., US Holdings and TXU Gas (parent companies)
for the purposes, in each case, of issuing trust securities and holding Junior
Subordinated Debentures issued by the Trust's parent company (Debentures). TXU
Corp. Capital I and II Trust Securities have a liquidation preference of $25
per unit, and TXU Gas Capital I Trust Securities have a liquidation preference
of $1,000 per unit. The only assets of each Trust are Debentures of its parent
company having a principal amount set forth under "Trust Assets" in the table
below. The interest on Trust assets matches the distributions on the Trust
Securities. Each Trust uses interest payments received on the Debentures it
holds to make cash distributions on the Trust Securities it has issued.

   The Trust Securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the
Debentures at maturity or upon redemption. The Debentures are subject to
redemption, in whole or in part at the option of the parent company, at 100% of
their principal amount plus accrued interest, after an initial period during
which they may not be redeemed and at any time upon the occurrence of certain
events. The carrying value of the Trust Securities is increased periodically to
equal the redemption amounts at the mandatory redemption dates with a
corresponding increase in Trust Securities distributions.

   In December 2001, in connection with the restructuring and refinancing plans
of US Holdings to comply with the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, the TXU
Electric Capital I and Capital III Trust Securities, with liquidation
preferences of $25 per unit, were redeemed for $141 and $194 million,

                                     C-64

<PAGE>

respectively. In addition, US Holdings redeemed $99 million of the $100 million
of outstanding TXU Electric Capital IV Trust Securities and $392 million of the
$400 million outstanding amount of its TXU Electric Capital V Trust Securities,
both of which had a liquidation preference of $1,000 per unit. Following the
completion of the redemption, the Capital IV and V Trusts were liquidated. The
capital securities held by the security holders were refinanced by proceeds of
junior subordinated debentures of US Holdings, which are classified on the
balance sheet as other long-term debt.

   The statutory business trust subsidiaries of TXU Corp., US Holdings and TXU
Gas had Trust Securities outstanding and Trust Assets as follows at December 31:

   Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Perpetual Trust of TXU Europe -- In March
2000, TXU Europe Capital I, a statutory business trust established as a
financing subsidiary for TXU Europe, issued to investors $150 million of 9 3/4%
Trust Originated Preferred Securities (Preferred Trust Securities), in
6,000,000 units. The proceeds from this issuance were invested in Preferred
Partnership Securities issued by TXU Europe Funding I, L.P., a limited
partnership of which TXU Europe is the general partner. The Preferred Trust
Securities have a liquidation preference of $25 per unit. The only

                                     C-66

assets of the trust are the Preferred Partnership Securities. The trust has a
perpetual existence, subject to certain termination events as provided in its
Amended and Restated Trust Agreement. The Preferred Trust Securities are
subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the Preferred Partnership
Securities which may be redeemed at the option of TXU Europe, in whole, or in
part, at any time on or after March 2, 2005. TXU Europe has issued certain
limited guarantees of the Preferred Trust Securities, the Preferred Partnership
Securities and the junior subordinated debentures held by TXU Europe Funding I,
L.P. The trust uses distributions it receives on the Preferred Partnership
Securities to make cash distributions on the Preferred Trust Securities.

10.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

   Common Stock Equity -- TXU Corp. has a Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) and a TXU Thrift Plan (Thrift Plan). During 2001, $12
million in common stock of TXU Corp. was issued to these plans. The
requirements under the DRIP and Thrift Plan have been met through open market
purchases of TXU Corp.'s common stock in 2000 and 1999.

   At December 31, 2001, the Thrift Plan had an obligation of $244 million
outstanding in the form of a note, which TXU Corp. purchased from the original
third-party lender in April 1990 and recorded as a reduction to common equity.
At December 31, 2001, the Thrift Plan trustee held 4,400,429 shares of common
stock (LESOP Shares) of TXU Corp. valued at $47.15 per share, under the
leveraged employee stock ownership provision of the Thrift Plan. LESOP Shares
are held by the trustee until allocated to Thrift Plan participants when
required to meet TXU Corp.'s obligations under terms of the Thrift Plan. The
Thrift Plan uses dividends on the LESOP Shares held and contributions from TXU
Corp., if required, to repay interest and principal on the note. Common stock
equity increases at such time as LESOP Shares are allocated to participants'
accounts although shares of common stock outstanding include unallocated LESOP
Shares held by the trustee. Allocations to participants' accounts increased
common stock equity by $9 million in 2001 and 2000 and $8 million in 1999.

   The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan is a comprehensive, stock-based
incentive compensation plan, providing for discretionary awards (Awards) of
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance
units, bonus stock and other stock-based awards. The maximum number of shares
of common stock for which Awards may be granted under the plan is 2,500,000 of
which 1,291,275 shares remain available for award. During 2001, 2000, and 1999,
the Board of Directors authorized the award of 535,052, 332,895 and 208,200
shares, respectively, of restricted common stock, which were issued subject to
performance and vesting requirements over a three- to five-year period.

   TXU Europe offers a Long-Term Incentive Plan, a Sharesave and a Loyalty
Award Plan to eligible UK-based employees. TXU Corp. applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for
its employee share plans. TXU Corp.'s compensation costs recorded for these
plans were $11 million, $12 million and $15 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Had compensation costs been determined based on SFAS No. 123,
there would have been no significant difference in the compensation expense
recognized.

   Effective with the merger of TXU Gas and TXU Corp., outstanding options for
TXU Gas common stock were exchanged for options for 532,913 shares of TXU
Corp.'s common stock. At December 31, 2001, 79,450 of these options remained
outstanding and exercisable at prices ranging from $19.75 to 28.83 per share.

   During 2001, TXU Corp. had two equity purchase agreements with separate
financial institutions to purchase shares of TXU Corp.'s common stock. In April
2001, TXU Corp. purchased 1,252,500 shares of its common stock for $44 million
under one of the equity purchase agreements. Following that purchase, TXU Corp.
terminated both contracts without purchasing additional shares. Settlement of
these agreements had no effect on earnings. During 2000, TXU Corp. repurchased
approximately 18.6 million shares of its common stock for $596 million through
open market purchases. Additional purchases may occur from time to time.

   Preference Stock -- In June 2000, TXU Corp. issued 3,000 shares of Series B
preference stock for $300 million. The preference stock has a dividend rate of
7.24% until June 15, 2005. The dividend rate for subsequent periods will be
determined according to periodic auctions. The Series B preference stock has a
liquidation preference of $100,000 per share. TXU Corp. may not redeem the
shares before June 15, 2005. TXU Corp. is authorized to issue up to 50 million
shares of preference stock in one or more series.

   Shareholders Rights Plan -- In February 1999, the Board of Directors adopted
a shareholder rights plan pursuant to which shareholders were granted rights to
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preference Stock (Rights) for
each share of TXU Corp.'s common stock held.

   In the event that any person acquires more than 15% of TXU Corp.'s
outstanding common stock, the Rights become exercisable, entitling each holder
(other than the acquiring person or group) to purchase that number of shares of
securities or other property of TXU Corp. having a market value equal to two
times the exercise price of the Rights. If TXU Corp. were acquired in a merger
or other business combination, each Right would entitle its holder to purchase
a number of the acquiring company's common shares having a market value of two
times the exercise price of the Right. In either case, TXU Corp.'s Board of
Directors may choose to redeem the Rights before they become exercisable. TXU
Corp.'s Board declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of
Common Stock. Rights were distributed to shareholders of record on March 1,
1999.

   At December 31, 2001, TXU Corp. had $540 million of alternative minimum tax
credit carryforwards available to offset future tax payments. At December 31,
2001, TXU Gas had pre-merger net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $236
million that begin to expire in 2008. The NOL's can be used to offset future US
taxable income of TXU Corp. Due to a 1999 change in Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) regulations, TXU Corp. fully expects to utilize all its NOL's prior to
their expiration date. Accordingly, a $10 million deferred tax asset valuation
allowance recorded in 1998 was reversed in 1999. TXU Corp. utilized $42 million
of NOL's in 2001 and $42 million in 2000. At December 31, 2001, TXU Australia
had $415 million and TXU Europe had $498 million of tax loss carryforwards that
can be

                                     C-70

<PAGE>

used to offset future taxable income in their respective jurisdictions. These
tax loss carryforwards do not have expiration dates. TXU Europe has recorded a
valuation allowance of $202 million against the deferred tax assets related to
leased assets.

   The tax effect of the components included in accumulated other comprehensive
income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $47 million.

   TXU Corp.'s income tax returns are subject to examination by applicable tax
authorities. The IRS is currently examining the tax years ended 1993 through
1997. In management's opinion, an adequate provision has been made for any
future taxes that may be owed as a result of any examination. To the extent
that adjustments to income tax accounts of acquired businesses for periods
prior to their acquisition are required as a result of an examination, the
adjustment will be added to or deducted from goodwill.

12.  RETIREMENT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

   Most US employees are covered by various defined benefit pension plans which
provide benefits based on years of service and average earnings. The TXU
Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan), is a defined benefit pension plan sponsored
by TXU Corp. The Retirement Plan is a qualified pension plan under Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code) and is subject
to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (ERISA). Employees are eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan
upon their completion of one year of service and the attainment of age 21. All
benefits are funded by the participating employers. The Retirement Plan
provides benefits to participants under one of two formulas: (i) a cash balance
formula under which participants earn monthly contribution credits based on
their compensation and a combination of their age and years of service, plus
monthly interest credits, or (ii) a traditional defined benefit formula based
on years of service and the average earnings of the three years of highest
earnings.

   In addition, most US employees are eligible to participate in a qualified
savings plan, the TXU Thrift Plan (Thrift Plan). This plan is a
participant-directed defined contribution profit sharing plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, and is subject to the provisions of ERISA. The
Thrift Plan includes an employee stock ownership component. Under the terms of
the Thrift Plan, as amended effective January 1, 2002, employees who do not
earn more than the IRS threshold compensation limit used to determine highly
compensated employees may contribute, through pre-tax salary deferrals and/or
after-tax payroll deductions, a specified amount of compensation ranging from
1% to 20%. Employees who earn more than such threshold may contribute from 1%
to 16% of their compensation. Employer matching contributions are also made in
an amount equal to 100% of the first 6% of employee contributions for employees
who are covered under the cash balance formula of the Retirement Plan, and 75%
of the first 6% of employee contributions for employees who are covered under
the traditional defined benefit formula of the Retirement Plan. Employer
matching contributions are invested in TXU Corp. common stock. Contributions to
the Thrift Plan aggregated $16 million for 2001 and $15 million for 2000 and
1999.

   During 1999, certain US employees were offered and accepted early retirement
and settlement options resulting in curtailment losses and settlement gains. As
a portion of these costs are recoverable through rates, effects of the early
retirement options applicable to regulated business were recorded as regulatory
assets.

   TXU Europe participates in several defined benefit pension plans in the UK
which cover the majority of its employees. The benefits under these plans are
primarily based on years of credited service and final average compensation
levels as defined under the respective plan provisions. In the UK, the majority
of TXU Europe employees are members of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme

                                     C-71

<PAGE>

(ESPS) which provides pensions of a defined benefit nature for employees
throughout the electricity supply industry. The ESPS operates on the basis that
there is no cross-subsidy between employers and the funding of TXU Europe's
pension liabilities is, therefore, independent of the experience of other
participating employers. The assets of the ESPS are held in a separate
trustee-administered fund and consist principally of UK and European equities,
UK property holdings and cash. The pension cost relating to the TXU Europe
portion of the ESPS is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent
qualified actuaries using the projected unit method. The benefits under these
plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation levels as
defined under the respective plan provisions.

   TXU Australia sponsors various pension plans covering the majority of its
employees. TXU Australia's contributions to its defined contribution plans were
A$2.6 million ($1.3 million), A$2.0 million ($1.1 million) and A$1.8 million
($1.2 million) for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

   The pension information presented below has been adjusted to reflect the
impact of the following events in the UK during 2000: the sale of the metering
business (May 2000), the acquisition of Norweb Energi (August 2000) and the
related transfer of customer services personnel to Vertex (September 2000). As
a result of these events there has been a significant movement of employees out
of and into the pension scheme. The net effect of these curtailments and
settlements was a loss of less than (Pounds)1 million ($1.5 million) for 2000.
No adjustment has been made for the effects of the sale of the UK networks
business completed in January 2002.

   The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for the
pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$2,385 million and $2,171 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2001 and
$111 million and $77 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2000.

   In addition to the retirement plans, the US subsidiaries offer certain
health care and life insurance benefits to substantially all of their employees
and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees from TXU.
For employees retiring on or after January 1, 2002, the retiree contributions
required for such coverage vary based on a formula depending on the retiree's
age and years of service.

   The expected increase in costs of future benefits covered by the
postretirement benefit plans is projected using a health care cost trend rate
for pre-65 liabilities of 10% for 2002 decreasing by 1% each year until the
ultimate rate of 5% is reached in 2007. For post-65 liabilities the rate is 11%
for 2002 decreasing by 1% each year until the ultimate rate of 5% is reached in
2008. A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend
rate in each future year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at December 31, 2001 by approximately $109 million and other
postretirement benefits cost for 2001 by approximately $11 million. A one
percentage point

decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2001 by
approximately $90 million and other postretirement benefits cost for 2001 by
approximately $9 million.

13.  ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITIES

   In the course of providing comprehensive energy products and services to its
diversified client base, TXU Corp. engages in energy price risk management
activities. In addition to the purchase or sale of physical commodities, TXU
Corp. enters into futures contracts; swap agreements, where settlement is based
on the difference between a fixed and floating (index based) price for the
underlying commodity; exchange traded options; over-the-counter options, which
are settled in cash or in the physical delivery of the underlying commodity;
exchange-of-futures-for-physical transactions; energy exchange transactions;
storage activities; and other contractual arrangements. TXU Corp. may buy and
sell certain of these instruments to manage its exposure to price risk from
existing contractual commitments as well as other energy-related assets and
liabilities. It may also enter into contracts to take advantage of arbitrage
opportunities. In order to manage its exposure to the price risk associated
with these instruments, TXU Corp. has established trading policies and limits
and revalues its exposures against these benchmarks utilizing integrated energy
systems to capture, value and understand the portfolio risks. TXU Corp. also
periodically reviews these policies to ensure they are responsive to changing
market and business conditions.

   TXU Corp. applies mark-to-market accounting for its energy trading and risk
management activity and certain retail contracts. In accounting for energy
trading contracts, settlements of positions under which energy ownership is
exchanged (physical contracts) are recorded gross as revenues and purchases.
Gains and losses from settlements of financial positions are recorded net as
revenues. For energy trading contracts not yet settled, whether financial or
physical, changes in fair value are recorded net as revenues. Such fair value
changes are referred to as unrealized gains and losses from mark-to-market
valuations. When positions are settled and gains and losses are realized, the
previously recorded unrealized gains and losses from mark-to-market valuations
are reversed. The recognized, unrealized balances are included in energy
trading assets/liabilities.

14.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   The carrying amounts and related estimated fair values of TXU Corp.'s
significant financial instruments were as follows:

* Excludes capital leases.

   With the implementation of SFAS No. 133, on January 1, 2001, financial
instruments that are derivatives are now recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value. The fair value of these derivative

                                     C-75

<PAGE>

financial instruments are determined by internally developed methodologies
validated by comparison to quoted market prices from participating commercial
banks and investment bankers. For 2000, the fair values for off-balance sheet
instruments (interest rate and currency swaps) were based either on quotes or
the cost to terminate the agreements.

   The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock subject to mandatory
redemption are estimated at the lesser of either the call price or the market
value as determined by quoted market prices, where available, or, where not
available, at the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates
consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risk. The fair value
of trust securities is based on quoted market prices.

   Common stock has been reduced by the note receivable from the trustee of the
leveraged employee stock ownership provision of the Thrift Plan. The fair value
of such note is estimated at the lesser of TXU Corp.'s call price or the
present value of future cash flows discounted at rates consistent with
comparable maturities adjusted for credit risk.

   The fair value of the financial guarantees represent the maximum amount
payable should TXU Corp. or its subsidiaries fail to perform on all of their
guarantees. The likelihood of this happening is considered remote.

   The carrying amounts for financial assets classified as current assets and
the carrying amounts for financial liabilities classified as current
liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such
instruments. The fair values of other financial instruments for which carrying
amounts and fair values have not been presented are not materially different
than their related carrying amounts. Energy trading assets and liabilities, as
well as derivative commodity contracts, are recorded on the balance sheet at
fair value as described in Note 2.

15.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

   Clean Air Act -- The Federal Clean Air Act, as amended (Clean Air Act)
includes provisions which, among other things, place limits on SO\\2\\ and
NO\\x\\ emissions produced by generating units. US Holdings' capital
requirements have not been significantly affected by the requirements of the
Clean Air Act. In addition, all permits required for the air pollution control
provisions of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation have been applied for and US
Holdings has initiated a construction program to install control equipment to
achieve the required reductions.

   Purchased Power Contracts -- US Holdings and SESCO have entered into
contracts to purchase power through the year 2005. These contracts provide for
capacity payments subject to performance standards and energy payments based on
the actual power taken under contract. Capacity payments paid under these
contracts for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $196
million, $194 million and $235 million, respectively. TXU Energy Trading and
TXU Europe Energy Trading also have several power purchase contracts requiring
the payment of annual capacity fees.

   Assuming operating standards are achieved, future capacity payments under
existing agreements are estimated as follows:

   Gas Purchase Contracts -- TXU Corp. buys gas under various types of
long-term and short-term contracts in the US, Europe and Australia in order to
assure reliable supply to and to help meet the expected needs of its generation
assets and its wholesale and retail customers. Many of these gas purchase
contracts require minimum purchases ("take-or-pay") of gas under which the
buyer agrees to pay for a minimum quantity of gas in a year. At December 31,
2001 TXU Corp. had estimated annual minimum commitments under long-term gas
purchase contracts covering the periods below:

   On the basis of TXU Corp.'s current expectations of demand from its
electricity and gas customers in each of these regions as compared with its
capacity payments or take-or-pay obligations under such purchase contracts,
management does not consider it likely that any material payments will become
due from TXU Corp. for electricity or gas not taken.

   Coal Contracts -- TXU Corp. has coal purchase agreements and coal
transportation agreements. Commitments under these contracts for the next five
years and thereafter are as follows:

   Leases -- Subsidiaries of TXU Corp. have entered into operating leases
covering various facilities and properties including generating plants,
combustion turbines, transportation, mining equipment, data processing
equipment and office space. Certain of these leases contain renewal and
purchase options and residual value guarantees. Lease costs charged to
operating expense for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $217 million, $192 million and
$212 million, respectively.

   Future minimum lease payments under capital leases, together with the
present value of such minimum lease payments, and future minimum lease
commitments under operating leases that have initial or remaining
noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2001, were

   Substantially all of the capital lease obligations relating to the
coal-fired power stations in the UK were terminated or transferred in 2001 with
the sale and transfer of the four generating plants.

   Financial Guarantees -- US Holdings has entered into contracts with public
agencies to purchase cooling water for use in the generation of electric energy
and has agreed, in effect, to guarantee the principal, $19 million at December
31, 2001, and interest on bonds issued to finance the reservoirs from which the
water is supplied. The bonds mature at various dates through 2011 and have
interest rates ranging from 5 1/2% to 7%. US Holdings is required to make
periodic payments equal to such principal and interest, including amounts
assumed by a third party and reimbursed to US Holdings, of $4 million annually
for the years 2002 through 2003, $7 million for 2004 and $1 million for 2005
and 2006. Annual payments made by US Holdings, net of amounts assumed by a
third party under such contracts, for 1999, 2000 and 2001 were $4 million each
year. In addition, US Holdings is obligated to pay certain variable costs of
operating and maintaining the reservoirs. US Holdings has assigned to a
municipality all contract rights and obligations of US Holdings in connection
with $30 million remaining principal amount of bonds at December 31, 2001,
issued for similar purposes which had previously been guaranteed by US
Holdings. US Holdings is, however, contingently liable in the unlikely event of
default by the municipality.

   In conjunction with various power purchase contracts requiring the payment
of annual capacity fees, at December 31, 2001, TXU Europe has provided a
(Pounds)300 million ($448 million) guarantee (declining over time) representing
approximately one year's capacity payment, with the counterparty providing a
(Pounds)170 million ($254 million) guarantee.

   TXU Europe has guaranteed up to (Pounds)76 million ($110 million) at
December 31, 2001 of certain liabilities that may be incurred and payable by
the purchasers of The Energy Group's (TEG) US and Australian coal business and
US energy marketing operations sold in 1998 prior to acquisition by TXU Corp.
These guarantees are with respect to the Peabody Holding Company Retirement
Plan for Salaried Employees, the Powder River Coal Company Retirement Plan and
the Peabody Coal UMWA Retirement Plan, subject to certain specified conditions.

   TEG entered into various guarantees of obligations of affiliates of its
former subsidiary Citizens Power LLC, arising under power purchase agreements
and note purchase agreements in connection with various Citizens Power energy
restructuring projects, as well as various indemnity agreements in connection
with such projects. TXU Europe and TEG continue to be either the guarantor or
the indemnifying party, as the case may be, under these various agreements.

   In connection with the transfer of a generation plant through a leasing
arrangement, TXU Europe has committed to provide additional letter of credit
security of (Pounds)50 million ($75 million) in the event of a negative watch
or downgrade of its debt securities. TXU Europe has financing facilities
available to satisfy this commitment.

   Obligations with Respect to Investments in Partnerships and Other
Unconsolidated Entities -- In August 2000, TXU Corp. formed a joint venture
with third-party investors and contributed the stock of its telecommunications
subsidiaries to Pinnacle One Partners, L.P. (Pinnacle or the joint venture).
The businesses contributed had a net book value of $477 million, including
goodwill of $353 million. TXU Corp. received a 50% voting interest in the joint
venture and approximately $600 million in cash. Third-party investors
contributed $150 million in cash in exchange for the remaining 50% voting
interest. No gain was recorded on the formation of the joint venture. TXU
Corp.'s investment in Pinnacle is accounted for using the equity method. Assets
of the joint venture are not TXU Corp.'s and are not available to pay creditors
of TXU Corp. Pinnacle's principal investment is in TXU Communications Ventures
Company (TXU Communications). TXU Communications operates a diversified
telecommunications business, including regulated incumbent local exchange
carriers, a competitive telecommunications service provider and a fiber optic
transport business.

   In connection with its formation, Pinnacle issued $810 million in senior
secured notes due August 15, 2004. The notes are secured by all of Pinnacle's
assets, including its shares of TXU Communications. Total proceeds (net of
transaction costs), including the $150 million received from third-party
investors, were used to make the $600 million cash distribution to TXU Corp.
and fund a trust with $336 million. The principal and interest on the trust
funds is being used to pay interest on the senior secured notes and
distributions to the third-party investors. The trust invested in TXU Corp.
debt securities.

   TXU Corp. provides a $200 million revolving credit facility to TXU
Communications, expiring 2004, of which $153 million was outstanding as of
December 31, 2001. In addition, TXU Corp. has made and may make future capital
contributions to Pinnacle to fund a portion of TXU Communications' capital
expenditures. TXU Corp. also provides administrative services to Pinnacle and
its affiliates at cost.

   In connection with the Pinnacle transaction, TXU Corp. issued 810,000 shares
of Mandatorily Convertible Single Reset Preference Stock, Series C (Series C
Preference Stock) to Pinnacle One Share Trust, a consolidated trust (Share
Trust). The Series C Preference Stock is convertible into common stock of TXU
Corp. In the event of:

      a) a default by Pinnacle in connection with its $810 million of senior
   secured notes,

      b) a decline in the market price of TXU Corp. common stock below $21.93
   per share coupled with a decline in the credit rating for TXU Corp.'s
   unsecured, senior long-term obligations to or below BB by Standard & Poor's
   or Fitch or Ba by Moody's, or

      c) Pinnacle's inability to raise sufficient cash to repay its senior
   secured notes 120 days prior to maturity through the sale of its shares of
   TXU Communications or the sale of assets of TXU Communications,

TXU Corp. would be required to sell equity or otherwise raise proceeds
sufficient to repay Pinnacle's senior secured notes. If TXU Corp. did not raise
sufficient proceeds, the Share Trust could be required to sell some or all of
the Series C Preference Stock. The dividend rate and conversion price of the
Series C Preference Stock would be reset at the time of sale to generate
proceeds sufficient to redeem the senior secured notes. TXU Corp. expects that
it would be able to sell equity or debt securities to satisfy its contingent
obligations to repay Pinnacle's debt.

   Had TXU Corp. been required to consolidate Pinnacle at December 31, 2001,
TXU Corp.'s debt would have increased by approximately $569 million. TXU Corp.
does not believe that a consolidation of Pinnacle would have had a material
impact on its liquidity or financial condition.

   Nuclear Insurance -- With regard to liability coverage, the Price-Anderson
Act (Act) provides financial protection for the public in the event of a
significant nuclear power plant incident. The Act sets the statutory limit of
public liability for a single nuclear incident currently at $9.5 billion and
requires nuclear power plant operators to provide financial protection for this
amount. The Act is being considered by the United States Congress for
modification. The terms of a modification, if any, are not presently known and
therefore TXU Energy is unable, at this time, to determine any impact it may
have on nuclear liability coverage. As required, TXU Energy provides this
financial protection for a nuclear incident at Comanche Peak resulting in
public bodily injury and property damage through a combination of private
insurance and industry-wide retrospective payment plans. As the first layer of
financial protection, TXU Energy has $200 million of liability insurance from
American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), which provides such insurance on behalf of a
major stock insurance company pool, Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance
Association. The second layer of financial protection is provided under an
industry-wide retrospective payment program called Secondary Financial
Protection (SFP).

                                     C-79

<PAGE>

   Under the SFP, each operating licensed reactor in the United States is
subject to an assessment of up to $88 million, subject to increases for
inflation every five years, in the event of a nuclear incident at any nuclear
plant in the United States. Assessments are limited to $10 million per
operating licensed reactor per year per incident. All assessments under the SFP
are subject to a 3% insurance premium tax, which is not included in the above
amounts.

   With respect to nuclear decontamination and property damage insurance,
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations require that nuclear plant
license-holders maintain not less than $1.1 billion of such insurance and
require the proceeds thereof to be used to place a plant in a safe and stable
condition, to decontaminate it pursuant to a plan submitted to and approved by
the NRC before the proceeds can be used for plant repair or restoration or to
provide for premature decommissioning. TXU Energy maintains nuclear
decontamination and property damage insurance for Comanche Peak in the amount
of $3.45 billion, above which TXU Energy is self-insured. The primary layer of
coverage of $500 million is provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited
(NEIL), a nuclear electric utility industry mutual insurance company. The
remaining coverage includes premature decommissioning coverage and is provided
by NEIL in the amount of $2.25 billion and $700 million from Lloyds of London,
other insurance markets and foreign nuclear insurance pools. TXU Energy is
subject to a maximum annual assessment from NEIL of $25.7 million in the event
NEIL's losses under this type of insurance for major incidents at nuclear
plants participating in these programs exceed the mutual's accumulated funds
and reinsurance.

   TXU Energy maintains Extra Expense Insurance through NEIL to cover the
additional costs of obtaining replacement power from another source if one or
both of the units at Comanche Peak are out of service for more than twelve
weeks as a result of covered direct physical damage. The coverage provides for
weekly payments of $3.5 million for the first fifty-two weeks and $2.8 million
for the next 110 weeks for each outage, respectively, after the initial
twelve-week period. The total maximum coverage is $490 million per unit. The
coverage amounts applicable to each unit will be reduced to 80% if both units
are out of service at the same time as a result of the same accident. Under
this coverage, TXU Energy is subject to a maximum annual assessment of $8.5
million per year.

   There have been some revisions made to the nuclear property and nuclear
liability insurance policies regarding the maximum recoveries available for
multiple terrorism occurrences. Under the NEIL policies, if there were multiple
terrorism losses occurring within one year beginning with the first loss from
terrorism, NEIL would make available one industry aggregate limit of $3.24
billion and any amounts it recovers from reinsurance, government indemnity or
other sources up to the limits for each claimant. If terrorism losses occurred
beyond the one-year period, a new set of limits and resources would apply.
Under the ANI liability policy, the liability arising out of terrorist acts
will be subject to one industry aggregate limit of $200 million which could be
reinstated at ANI's option depending on prevailing risk circumstances and the
balance in the Industry Credit Rating Plan reserve fund.

   Nuclear Decommissioning -- US Holdings has established a reserve, charged to
depreciation expense and included in accumulated depreciation, for the
decommissioning of Comanche Peak. Decommissioning costs are being recovered
from Oncor customers over the life of the plant and deposited in external trust
funds (included in investments). As of December 31, 2001, the market value of
deposits in the external trust for decommissioning of Comanche Peak was $276
million, including unrealized gains of $57 million. Realized earnings on funds
deposited in the external trust are recognized in the reserve. Based on a
site-specific study completed during 1997 using the prompt dismantlement method
and 1997 dollars, decommissioning costs for Comanche Peak Unit 1 and for Unit 2
and common facilities were estimated to be $271 million and $404 million,
respectively. This estimate is subject to change in the future.

   Decommissioning activities are projected to begin in 2030 for Comanche Peak
Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2 and common facilities. Through December 31, 2001,
decommissioning costs were recovered

                                     C-80

<PAGE>

based upon a 1992 site-specific study through rates placed in effect under US
Holdings' January 1993 rate increase request. US Holdings accrued $18 million
of decommissioning costs for each of the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999. Effective January 1, 2002, decommissioning costs will be recovered
through a non-bypassable charge by Oncor and remitted to TXU Energy based upon
a 1997 site-specific study, adjusted for trust fund assets, through rates
placed in effect under US Holdings' 2001 Unbundled Cost of Service filing.

   Because the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are
recovered through rates or a non-bypassable charge to customers, fluctuations
in equity prices or interest rates of trust fund assets do not affect results
of operations, cash flows or financial position.

   Legal Proceedings -- UK -- On January 25, 1999, the Hindustan Development
Corporation (HDC) issued arbitration proceedings in the Arbitral Tribunal in
Delhi, India against TEG (now Energy Holdings (No.3) Limited), claiming damages
of (Pounds)255 million ($370 million) for breach of contract following the
termination of a Joint Development Agreement dated March 20, 1997 relating to
the construction, development and operation of a lignite based thermal power
plant at Barsingsar, Rajasthan. On November 21, 2000, the Arbitrators issued
their decision and dismissed HDC's claim in full, and TEG was liable for only
its own legal costs involved in the case, an estimated (Pounds)1 million ($1.4
million). On December 21, 2000, HDC filed a Request for Clarification of the
Arbitrators' decision (Request) under Section 33 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, the purpose of which is to entitle a party to arbitration to
seek clarification of language used in the Arbitrators' decision. TEG filed its
response to the Request on January 15, 2001 asserting that the Request was
untimely made and that the language used by the Arbitrators needed no
clarification. TXU Europe believes that the Arbitrators' will have no
alternative but to dismiss the Request. While the effect of filing the Request
has been to stay the time HDC has to file an appeal of the Arbitrators'
decision, TXU Europe regards this matter as concluded.

   On November 29, 2001, various subsidiaries of Enron Corporation (Enron) went
into Administration (bankruptcy) in the UK. Prior to Enron's going into
Administration, TXU Europe Energy Trading (TXUEET) had certain energy purchase
and sales contracts with Enron that had been entered into in the ordinary
course of business. The terms of these contracts provided that they terminated
automatically upon a party going into Administration. Also, on November 29,
2001 just prior to Enron going into Administration, TXUEET received a notice
from Enron purporting to terminate these contracts for cause. TXUEET and the
Administrator have had discussions regarding potential claims relating to
contract termination; Enron has filed an action in the High Court, London,
relating to interpretation of contractual provisions; and TXUEET plans to seek
a judicial determination regarding contract termination. While the outcome of
these matters cannot be predicted, TXUEET believes, consistent with the advice
of external legal advisors in the UK, that the attempted termination of the
contracts by Enron was without substance. Accordingly, TXUEET believes any
related claims by Enron would be without merit.

   General -- In addition to the above, TXU Corp. and other subsidiaries are
involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings the ultimate
resolution of which, in the opinion of each, should not have a material effect
upon their financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

16.  SEGMENT INFORMATION

   Through December 31, 2001, TXU Corp. had five reportable operating segments
as reflected in the financial information included in this report. The segments
were either strategic business units that offered different products and
services or were geographically integrated. They were managed separately
because each business required different marketing strategies or was in a
different geographic area.

   (1) US Electric -- operations involving the generation, purchase,
transmission, distribution and retail sale of electric energy in the north
central, eastern and western portions of Texas;

                                     C-81

<PAGE>

   (2) US Gas -- operations involving the purchase, transmission, distribution
and sale of natural gas in Texas;

   (3) US Energy -- operations involving the wholesale trading of energy
(natural gas and electricity), risk management and retail energy sales and
services throughout the US and parts of Canada;

   (4) Europe -- operations involving electricity generation, purchase,
distribution, retail marketing and sale of energy, wholesale trading of energy
and risk management in the UK and continental Europe;

   (5) Australia -- operations involving electricity generation, purchase,
distribution, and retailing of energy, the storage of natural gas, wholesale
trading of energy and risk management, primarily in the States of Victoria and
South Australia; and

   All other -- operations consist primarily of general corporate expenses,
equity earnings/losses of unconsolidated affiliates, including the
telecommunications joint venture, and interest on debt at the TXU Corp. level.
Affiliated revenues represent intercompany service charges.

   The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. TXU Corp. evaluates performance
based on net income or loss. TXU Corp. accounts for intersegment sales and
transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at
current market prices.

   The following is a description of TXU Corp.'s realigned operating business
segments as of the January 1, 2002 restructuring. Reporting to management and
shareholders on this new segment basis will begin during the first quarter of
2002.

   (1) US Energy -- operations involving the generation of electricity,
wholesale energy trading and risk management, and retail energy sales and
services in the US and parts of Canada. The segment consists of all operations,
other than the transmission and distribution business, of the former US
Electric segment and the former US Energy segment;

   (2) International Energy -- operations involving the generation of
electricity, wholesale energy trading and risk management, and retail energy
sales and services in Europe and Australia. The segment consists of the
operations of the former Europe and Australia segments; and

   (3) US Energy Delivery -- operations involving the transmission and
distribution of electricity and the purchase, transmission, distribution and
sale of natural gas in Texas. The segment consists of the transmission and
distribution operations of the former US Electric segment and the operations of
the former US Gas segment.

17.  SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   Credit Risk -- Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that TXU Corp. would
incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties. TXU Corp. maintains
credit risk policies with regard to its counterparties to minimize overall
credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of a potential counterparty's
financial condition, credit rating, and other credit criteria and risk
mitigation tools as deemed appropriate, including but not limited to use of
standardized agreements that allow for netting

                                     C-83

<PAGE>

of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. TXU
has standardized processes for global monitoring and management of credit,
including common methodology to analyze counterparties' financial strength,
measurement of current counterparty exposures and contract language that
includes netting. Credit enhancements such as parental guarantees, letters of
credit, surety bonds and margin deposits are also utilized. Additionally,
counterparties and portfolios are stress tested for potential credit exposure
and managed to acceptable levels. This evaluation results in establishing
credit limits or collateral requirements prior to entering into an agreement
with a counterparty that creates credit exposure to TXU Corp. Additionally, TXU
Corp. has established controls to determine and monitor the appropriateness of
these limits on an ongoing basis. Any material adverse change in the financial
condition of a counterparty or downgrade of its credit quality will result in
the reassessment of the credit limit with that counterparty. This could result
in a reduction of the credit limit or request for additional financial
assurances.

   Concentration of Credit Risk -- TXU Corp.'s regional gross exposure to
trading and non-trading credit risk as of December 31, 2001 is as follows:

                                           ======
</TABLE>

   TXU Corp.'s gross exposure to credit risk represents trade accounts
receivable, energy trading assets and derivative assets. These regional
concentrations have the potential to affect TXU Corp.'s overall exposure to
credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customer base and
counterparties may be similarly affected, both regionally and globally, by
changes in economic, regulatory, industry, weather or other conditions. Global
credit coordination is in place to reduce credit limits on a global basis, to
provide transparency across regions and to communicate through various risk
committees and forums.

   The largest share of the gross assets subject to credit risk are accounts
receivable from the retail sale of electricity and gas to millions of
residential and small commercial customers. The risk of material loss from
nonperformance from these customers is not considered likely. Reserves for
uncollectible accounts receivable are provided for the potential loss from
nonpayment by these customers based on historical experience. The restructuring
of the electric industry in Texas effective January 1, 2002 increases the risk
profile of TXU Energy in relation to its customers; however, TXU Energy has the
ability to take actions to mitigate such customer risk. In addition, Oncor has
exposure to credit risk as a result of non-performance by REPs, which are
responsible for collecting its T&D charges.

   Most of the remaining trade accounts receivables are with large commercial
and industrial customers. TXU Corp.'s energy trading counterparties include
major energy companies, financial institutions, gas and electric utilities,
independent power producers, oil and gas producers and other energy trading
companies. The net exposure to credit risk from these counterparties as of
December 31, 2001 is $2,175 million using standardized master netting contracts
and agreements which provide for the right of offset of positive and negative
credit exposures with individual counterparties. Of this amount, approximately
79% of the associated credit exposure is considered to be with investment grade
counterparties, as determined using publicly available information including
major rating agencies' published ratings and TXU Corp.'s internal credit
evaluation. Those counterparties without a Standard & Poor's (S&P) rating of a
least BBB- or a similar rating from another major rating agency, are rated
using internal credit methodologies and credit scoring models which are used to
determine an S&P equivalent rating. Approximately 21% of the credit exposure is
considered

                                     C-84

<PAGE>

to be with counterparties rated as below investment grade or not rated. TXU
Corp. monitors and reports its exposures and limits on a daily basis and
provides regular reports to its regional and global risk monitoring committees
and treasury subcommittees.

   In December 2001, as a result of the Enron Corporation bankruptcy, TXU Corp.
considered its global exposure and taking into consideration netting
agreements, recorded a $22 million after-tax charge related to TXU Europe's
exposure to Enron.

   TXU Corp. had no exposure to any one customer that represented greater than
5% of the gross fair value of TXU's trade accounts receivable, energy trading
assets and derivative assets at December 31, 2001. Based on TXU Corp.'s
policies for managing credit risk, its exposures and its credit and other
reserves, TXU does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on its financial
position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any
counterparty.
