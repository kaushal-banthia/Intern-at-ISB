Item 4.	Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

	On December 4, 1996, the Audit and Finance 
Committee of the Registrant's Board of Directors 
recommended, and the Registrant's Board of Directors 
approved, the engagement of the independent certified 
public accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP to 
audit the consolidated financial statements of the 
Registrant for the year ending September 26, 1997. 
Accordingly, the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP as 
the Registrant's independent auditors was discontinued 
effective December 19, 1996. 

	The reports of Ernst & Young LLP on the 
Registrant's consolidated financial statements for each of 
the two fiscal years in the period ended September 27, 
1996 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer 
of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to 
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 

	In connection with the audits of the Registrant's 
consolidated financial statements for each of the two 
fiscal years ended September 27, 1996 and September 29, 
1995 and the subsequent interim period prior to and 
including December 19, 1996, there were no 
disagreements between the Registrant and Ernst & 
Young LLP on any matters of accounting principles or 
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing 
scope and procedures which, if not resolved to the 
satisfaction of Ernst & Young LLP, would have caused 
Ernst & Young LLP to make reference to the matter in 
their reports.

	There were no reportable events (as defined in 
Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(l)(v)) during the two fiscal 
years ended September 27, 1996 and September 29, 1995 
and the subsequent interim period prior to and 
including December 19, 1996.

	The Registrant has not consulted with KPMG 
Peat Marwick LLP during the last two years or 
subsequent interim period prior to and including 
December 19, 1996 on either the application of 
accounting principles or the type of opinion KPMG Peat 
Marwick LLP might issue on the Registrant's financial 
statements.

	The Registrant requested Ernst & Young LLP to 
furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission stating whether or not Ernst & 
Young LLP agrees with the above statements, which 
letter is attached as Exhibit 16.1.
