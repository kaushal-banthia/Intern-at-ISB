Item 4.  Ownership

         The information in items 1 and 5 through 11 on the cover pages (pp. 2-
         3) on Schedule 13G is hereby incorporated by reference.

         Janus Capital is a registered investment adviser which furnishes
         investment advice to several investment companies registered under
         Section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and individual and
         institutional clients (collectively referred to herein as "Managed
         Portfolios").  As a result of its role as investment adviser or sub-
         adviser to the Managed Portfolios, Janus Capital may be deemed to be
         the beneficial owner of the shares of Apple Computer Common Stock held
         by such Managed Portfolios.  However, Janus Capital does not have the
         right to receive any dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of,
         the securities held in the Managed Portfolios and disclaims any
         ownership associated with such rights.

         Mr. Bailey owns approximately 12.2% of Janus Capital.  In addition to
         being a stockholder of Janus Capital, Mr. Bailey serves as President
         and Chairman of the Board of Janus Capital and is filing this joint
         statement with Janus Capital as a result of such stock ownership and
         positions which may be deemed to enable him to exercise control over
         Janus Capital.  Mr. Bailey does not own of record any shares of Apple
         Computer Common Stock and he has not engaged in any transaction in
         Apple Computer Common Stock.  However, as a result of his position,
         Mr. Bailey may be deemed to have the power to exercise or to direct
         the exercise of such voting and/or dispositive power that Janus
         Capital may have with respect to Apple Computer Common Stock held by
         the Managed Portfolios.  All shares reported herein have been acquired
         by the Managed Portfolios, and Mr. Bailey specifically disclaims
         beneficial ownership over any shares of Apple Computer Common Stock
         that he or Janus Capital may be deemed to beneficially own.
         Furthermore, Mr. Bailey does not have the right to receive any
         dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities held
         in the Managed Portfolios and disclaims any ownership associated with
         such rights.<PAGE>

              have the right to receive all dividends from, and the proceeds
              from the sale of, the securities held in their respective
              accounts.

              The interest of any one such person does not exceed 5% of the
              class of securities.

              These shares were acquired in the ordinary course of business,
              and not with the purpose of changing or influencing control of
              the Issuer.

Item 10.      Certification

              By signing below I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
              belief, the securities referred to above were acquired in the
              ordinary course of business and were not acquired for the purpose
              of and do not have the effect of changing or influencing the
