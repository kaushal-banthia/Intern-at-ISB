SCHEDULE 13G - TO BE INCLUDED IN STATEMENTS  
FILED PURSUANT TO RULE 13d-1(b) or 13d-2(b)  
  
  
	Pursuant to instructions in Item 7 of Schedule 13G, this Exhibit has 
been  
prepared  to identify Fidelity International Limited, Pembroke Hall, 42 Crow  
Lane, Hamilton, Bermuda, a Bermudian joint stock company incorporated for an  
unlimited duration by private act of the Bermuda Legislature (FIL) and an  
investment adviser to various investment companies (the "International Funds")  
and certain institutional investors, as a beneficial owner of the 99,000  
shares or 0.08% of the common stock outstanding of Apple Computer  
Incorporated.  
  
	Prior to June 30, 1980, FIL was a majority-owned subsidiary of Fidelity  
Management & Research Company (Fidelity), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR  
Corp.  On that date, the shares of FIL held by Fidelity were distributed, as a  
dividend,  to the shareholders of FMR Corp.  FIL currently operates as an  
entity independent of FMR Corp. and Fidelity.  The International Funds and  
FIL's other clients, with the exception of Fidelity and an affiliated company  
of Fidelity, are non-U.S. entities.  
  
	A partnership controlled by Edward C. Johnson 3d and members of his  
family owns shares of FIL voting stock with the right to cast approximately  
47.22% of the total votes which may be cast by all holders of FIL voting  
stock.  Mr. Johnson 3d is Chairman of FMR Corp. and FIL.  FMR Corp. and FIL  
are separate and independent corporate entities.  FMR Corp. and FIL are  
managed independently and their Boards of Directors are generally composed of  
different individuals.  Other than when one serves as a subadviser to the  
other, their investment decisions are made independently, and their clients  
are different organizations.  
  
	FMR Corp. and FIL are of the view that they are not acting as a "group"  
for purposes of Section 13(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  
"1934" Act) and that they are not otherwise required to attribute to each  
other the "beneficial ownership" of securities "beneficially owned" by the  
other corporation within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934  
Act.  Therefore, they are of the view that the shares held by the other  
corporation need not be aggregated for purposes of Section 13(d). However, FMR  
Corp. is making this filing on a voluntary basis as if all of the shares are  
beneficially owned by FMR Corp. and FIL on a joint basis.  
  
	FIL may continue to have the International Funds or other accounts  
purchase shares subject to a number of factors, including, among others, the  
availability of shares for sale at what FIL considers to be reasonable prices  
and other investment opportunities that may be available to the International  
Funds.  
  
	FIL intends to review continuously the equity position of the  
International Funds and other accounts in the Company.  Depending upon its  
future evaluations of the business and prospects of the Company and upon other  
developments, including, but not limited to, general economic and business  
conditions and money market and stock market conditions, FIL may determine to  
cease making additional purchases of shares or to increase or decrease the  
equity interest in the Company by acquiring additional shares, or by disposing  
of all or a portion of the shares.  
  
	FIL does not have a present plan or proposal which relates to or would  
result in (i) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,  
reorganization, liquidation, or sale or transfer of a material amount of  
assets involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any change in  
the Company's present Board of Directors or management, (iii) any material  
changes in the Company's present capitalization or dividend policy or any  
other material change in the Company's business or corporate structure, (iv)  
any change in the Company's charter or by-laws, or (v) the Company's common  
stock becoming eligible for termination of its registration pursuant to  
Section 12(g)(4) of the 1934 Act.  
  
	FIL has the sole power to vote and the sole power to dispose of 99,000  
shares.
