of 1940, is the beneficial owner of 42,931,452 shares or

which power resides with the Funds' Boards of Trustees.

adviser registered under Section 203 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, is the beneficial owner of 636,970

Incorporated as a result of its serving as investment adviser to
institutional accounts, non-U.S. mutual funds, or investment

in Section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is

of the Company.

	Partnerships controlled predominantly by members of
the family of Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman of FMR LLC
and FIL, or trusts for their benefit, own shares of FIL voting
stock with the right to cast approximately 47% of the total
votes which may be cast by all holders of FIL voting stock.
FMR LLC and FIL are separate and independent corporate
entities, and their Boards of Directors are generally composed
of different individuals.

	FMR LLC and FIL are of the view that they are not
acting as a "group" for purposes of Section 13(d) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934" Act) and that
they are not otherwise required to attribute to each other the
"beneficial ownership" of securities "beneficially owned" by
the other corporation within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the 1934 Act.  Therefore, they are of the
view that the shares held by the other corporation need not be
aggregated for purposes of Section 13(d). However, FMR
LLC is making this filing on a voluntary basis as if all of the
shares are beneficially owned by FMR LLC and FIL on a joint
basis.

	FIL has sole dispositive power over 824,835 shares
owned by the International Funds. FIL has sole power to vote
or direct the voting of 768,185 shares and no power to vote or
