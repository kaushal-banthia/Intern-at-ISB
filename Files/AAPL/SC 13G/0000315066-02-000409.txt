	SCHEDULE 13G - TO BE INCLUDED IN
STATEMENTS
	FILED PURSUANT TO RULE 13d-1(b) or 13d-2(b)

	Pursuant to instructions in Item 7 of Schedule 13G, this
Exhibit has been prepared  to identify Fidelity International
Limited, Pembroke Hall, 42 Crow Lane, Hamilton, Bermuda,
a Bermudan joint stock company incorporated for an
unlimited duration by private act of the Bermuda Legislature
(FIL) and an investment adviser to various investment
companies (the "International Funds") and certain institutional
investors, as a beneficial owner of the 366,600 shares or
0.105% of the Common Stock outstanding of Apple Computer
Incorporated.

	Prior to June 30, 1980, FIL was a majority-owned
subsidiary of Fidelity Management & Research Company
(Fidelity), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR Corp.  On that
date, the shares of FIL held by Fidelity were distributed, as a
dividend,  to the shareholders of FMR Corp.  FIL currently
operates as an entity independent of FMR Corp. and Fidelity.
The International Funds and FIL's other clients, with the
exception of Fidelity and an affiliated company of Fidelity, are
non-U.S. entities.

	A partnership controlled by Edward C. Johnson 3d and
members of his family owns shares of FIL voting stock with
the right to cast approximately 39.89% of the total votes which
may be cast by all holders of FIL voting stock.  Mr. Johnson
3d is Chairman of FMR Corp. and FIL.  FMR Corp. and FIL
are separate and independent corporate entities, and their
Boards of Directors are generally composed of different
individuals.  Other than when one serves as a sub adviser to
the other, their investment decisions are made independently,
and their clients are generally different organizations.

	FMR Corp. and FIL are of the view that they are not
acting as a "group" for purposes of Section 13(d) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934" Act) and that
they are not otherwise required to attribute to each other the
"beneficial ownership" of securities "beneficially owned" by
the other corporation within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the 1934 Act.  Therefore, they are of the
view that the shares held by the other corporation need not be
aggregated for purposes of Section 13(d). However, FMR
Corp. is making this filing on a voluntary basis as if all of the
shares are beneficially owned by FMR Corp. and FIL on a
joint basis.

	FIL may continue to have the International Funds or
other accounts purchase shares subject to a number of factors,
including, among others, the availability of shares for sale at
what FIL considers to be reasonable prices and other
investment opportunities that may be available to the
International Funds.

	FIL intends to review continuously the equity position
of the International Funds and other accounts in the Company.
Depending upon its future evaluations of the business and
prospects of the Company and upon other developments,
including, but not limited to, general economic and business
conditions and money market and stock market conditions,
FIL may determine to cease making additional purchases of
shares or to increase or decrease the equity interest in the
Company by acquiring additional shares, or by disposing of all
or a portion of the shares.

	FIL does not have a present plan or proposal which
relates to or would result in (i) an extraordinary corporate
transaction, such as a merger, reorganization, liquidation, or
sale or transfer of a material amount of assets involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any change in the
Company's present Board of Directors or management, (iii)
any material changes in the Company's present capitalization
or dividend policy or any other material change in the
Company's business or corporate structure, (iv) any change in
the Company's charter or by-laws, or (v) the Company's
common stock becoming eligible for termination of its
registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the 1934 Act.

	FIL  has sole power to vote and the sole power to
dispose of  366,600  shares.
