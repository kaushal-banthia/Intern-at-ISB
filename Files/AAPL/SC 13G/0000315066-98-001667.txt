	Pursuant to the instructions in Item 7 of Schedule 13G, Fidelity  
Management & Research Company ("Fidelity"), 82 Devonshire Street, Boston,

is the beneficial owner of 14,078,334 shares or 10.38% of the common stock  
outstanding of Apple Computer Incorporated ("the Company") as a result of  
acting as investment adviser to various investment companies registered under  
Section 8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and as a result of acting as  
sub-adviser to Fidelity American Special Situations Trust ("FASST").  The  
number of shares of common stock of Apple Computer Incorporated owned by the  
investment companies at July 31, 1998 included 2,393,033 shares of common  
stock resulting from the assumed conversion of $69,890,000 principal amount of  
Apple Computer Convertible 6% 6/1/01 (34.240712 shares of common stock for  
each $1,000 principal amount of debenture).  
  
	FASST is a unit trust established and authorized by the Department of  
Trade and Industry under the laws of England.  The investment adviser of FASST  
is Fidelity Investment Services Limited, an English company and a subsidiary  
of Fidelity International Limited ("FIL").

funds each has sole power to dispose of the 14,056,434 shares owned by the  
Funds.  
  
	Neither FMR Corp. nor Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman of FMR Corp., has  
the sole power to vote or direct the voting of the shares owned directly by  
the Fidelity Funds, which power resides with the Funds' Boards of Trustees.   
Fidelity carries out the voting of the shares under written guidelines  
established by the Funds' Boards of Trustees.  
  
	FIL, FMR Corp., through its control of Fidelity, and FASST each has sole  
power to vote and to dispose of the 21,900 shares held by FASST.  
  
	Fidelity Management Trust Company, 82 Devonshire Street, Boston,  
Massachusetts 02109, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR Corp. and a bank as  
defined in Section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is the

Management Trust Company, each has sole dispositive power over 2,170,138  
shares and sole power to vote or to direct the voting of 1,484,974 shares, and  
no power to vote or to direct the voting of 685,164 Sharesshares of common

	Members of the Edward C. Johnson 3d family and trusts for their benefit

representing approximately 49% of the voting power of FMR Corp.  Mr. Johnson

voting stock of FMR Corp.  Mr. Johnson 3d is Chairman of FMR Corp. and Abigail  
P. Johnson is a Director of FMR Corp.  The Johnson family group and all other  
Class B shareholders have entered into a shareholders' voting agreement under  
which all Class B shares will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of  
Class B shares.  Accordingly, through their ownership of voting common stock  
and the execution of the shareholders' voting agreement, members of the  
Johnson family may be deemed, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, to  
form a controlling group with respect to FMR Corp.    
	Fidelity International Limited, Pembroke Hall, 42 Crowlane, Hamilton,  
Bermuda, and various foreign-based subsidiaries provide investment advisory  
and management services to a number of non-U.S. investment companies (the

SCHEDULE 13G - TO BE INCLUDED IN STATEMENTS  
FILED PURSUANT TO RULE 13d-1(b) or 13d-2(b)  
  
  
	Pursuant to instructions in Item 7 of Schedule 13G, this Exhibit has been  
prepared  to identify Fidelity International Limited, Pembroke Hall, 42 Crow  
Lane, Hamilton, Bermuda, a Bermudan joint stock company incorporated for an  
unlimited duration by private act of the Bermuda Legislature (FIL) and an  
investment adviser to various investment companies (the "International Funds")  
and certain institutional investors, as a beneficial owner of the 438,960  
shares or 0.32% of the common stock outstanding of Apple Computer  
Incorporated, which includes 21,900 shares or 0.02% of the common stock  
outstanding of the Company owned by FASST.  
  
	Prior to June 30, 1980, FIL was a majority-owned subsidiary of Fidelity  
Management & Research Company (Fidelity), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR  
Corp.  On that date, the shares of FIL held by Fidelity were distributed, as a  
dividend,  to the shareholders of FMR Corp.  FIL currently operates as an  
entity independent of FMR Corp. and Fidelity.  The International Funds and  
FIL's other clients, with the exception of Fidelity and an affiliated company  
of Fidelity, are non-U.S. entities.  
  
	A partnership controlled by Edward C. Johnson 3d and members of his  
family owns shares of FIL voting stock with the right to cast approximately  
39.89% of the total votes which may be cast by all holders of FIL voting  
stock.  Mr. Johnson 3d is Chairman of FMR Corp. and FIL.  FMR Corp. and FIL  
are separate and independent corporate entities, and their Boards of Directors  
are generally composed of different individuals.  Other than when one serves  
as a sub adviser to the other, their investment decisions are made  
independently, and their clients are generally different organizations.  
  
	FMR Corp. and FIL are of the view that they are not acting as a "group"  
for purposes of Section 13(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  
"1934" Act) and that they are not otherwise required to attribute to each  
other the "beneficial ownership" of securities "beneficially owned" by the  
other corporation within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the 1934  
Act.  Therefore, they are of the view that the shares held by the other  
corporation need not be aggregated for purposes of Section 13(d). However, FMR  
Corp. is making this filing on a voluntary basis as if all of the shares are  
beneficially owned by FMR Corp. and FIL on a joint basis.  
  
	FIL may continue to have the International Funds or other accounts  
purchase shares subject to a number of factors, including, among others, the  
availability of shares for sale at what FIL considers to be reasonable prices  
and other investment opportunities that may be available to the International  
Funds.  
  
	FIL intends to review continuously the equity position of the  
International Funds and other accounts in the Company.  Depending upon its  
future evaluations of the business and prospects of the Company and upon other  
developments, including, but not limited to, general economic and business  
conditions and money market and stock market conditions, FIL may determine to  
cease making additional purchases of shares or to increase or decrease the  
equity interest in the Company by acquiring additional shares, or by disposing  
of all or a portion of the shares.  
  
	FIL does not have a present plan or proposal which relates to or would  
result in (i) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,  
reorganization, liquidation, or sale or transfer of a material amount of  
assets involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any change in  
the Company's present Board of Directors or management, (iii) any material  
changes in the Company's present capitalization or dividend policy or any  
other material change in the Company's business or corporate structure, (iv)  
any change in the Company's charter or by-laws, or (v) the Company's common  
stock becoming eligible for termination of its registration pursuant to  
Section 12(g)(4) of the 1934 Act.  
  
	FIL has the sole power to vote and the sole power to dispose of 417,060  
shares.  FIL, FMR Corp., through its control of Fidelity, and FASST each has  
sole power to vote and to dispose of the 21,900 shares held by FASST.
