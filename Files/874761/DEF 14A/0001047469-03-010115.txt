<P><FONT SIZE=2>March&nbsp;26,
2003 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
accompanying proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors of The AES Corporation (the "Company" or "AES") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held at
9:30&nbsp;a.m. on Thursday, May&nbsp;1, 2003 at the Company's corporate offices, 1001 North 19th Street, Arlington, Virginia, or at any adjournment of such meeting. This Proxy Statement and
accompanying proxy are first being sent or given to stockholders on or about March&nbsp;26, 2003. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If
the proxy is properly executed, the shares it represents will be voted at the meeting in accordance with the instructions noted thereon. If no instructions are specified with respect to the matters
to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendations for each proposal as set forth herein. Any stockholder executing a proxy has the power to revoke
it at any time before it is voted at the meeting by filing a written notice of revocation with the Company, by delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting
of Stockholders and voting in person. Proxies marked as abstentions, or to withhold a vote from a nominee as a director in the case of the election of directors, will have the effect of a negative
vote. Broker non-votes (where a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner with respect to a particular matter and such
nominee does not possess or choose to exercise his discretionary authority with respect thereto) will be considered as present at the meeting but not entitled to vote with respect to the particular
matter and will therefore have no effect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
only securities of the Company entitled to be voted are shares of Common Stock, and only holders of record of Common Stock at the close of business on March&nbsp;3, 2003 are entitled to notice
of and to vote at the meeting. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. There were 564,542,183 shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on March&nbsp;3, 2003.
The Company's Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 is being delivered concurrently with this Proxy Statement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Proposal 1  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Board of Directors presently submits the names of ten persons ("Nominees") for election to Director. Only one of the Nominees, Paul T. Hanrahan, is also an employee of the Company. In 2002, the
Board of Directors met 26 times, including 15 telephonic meetings. Directors are elected to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their respective successors have been
elected and qualified. Directors shall be elected by a majority of the votes of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, at which a
quorum is present. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Directors
who are also officers of AES are not paid any fees or additional compensation for service as members of AES's Board of Directors or any committee thereof. Each Director who is not employed
by AES received $33,000 as annual cash compensation for service on the Board of Directors for 2002, and $2,000 for each Board meeting attended in person and $750 for each Board meeting in which he or
she participated by telephone conference. A non-executive Chairman receives $82,500 as annual cash compensation for service on the Board of Directors, and $5,000 for each Board meeting
attended in person and $1,875 for each Board meeting in which he or she participated by telephone conference. In 2002, the Board did not have a non-executive Chairman. The Directors may
elect to defer this compensation pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors in the form of stock units. All Directors are reimbursed for travel and other related expenses incurred in
attending Board and committee meetings. Directors who are not employed by AES are not eligible to participate in AES's employee benefit plans but participate in The AES Corporation 2001 Stock Option
Plan for Outside Directors. Under the terms of the plan, the Company issues options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock at a price equal to the quoted market price on the date the option
is granted. Directors eligible to participate in the plan receive options annually to purchase Common Stock valued on the grant date at $40,000, with a non-executive Chairman entitled to receive
options annually to purchase Common Stock valued on the grant date at $100,000. These options become eligible for exercise in installments of 50% at the end of each of the first two years. Directors
may elect to take their annual compensation consisting of the annual fee plus four regular meeting fees in the form of a stock option award. For each Director and/or non-executive Chairman
so electing, they will receive stock options equal to 1.50 times the cash value, and such stock option grants shall vest within one year of grant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Board has granted, subject to shareholder approval of a proposed amendment to The AES Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (see Proposal 3), a one-time option to
Lead Independent Director and Vice Chairman Richard Darman to purchase up to 300,000 shares of Common Stock at $2.75, the quoted market price on December&nbsp;3, 2002, the date on which
Mr.&nbsp;Darman was appointed Lead Independent Director. Mr.&nbsp;Darman's one-time grant shall vest and become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year. If Mr.&nbsp;Darman is elected
by the AES shareholders to serve as a Director of AES, the Board expects to vote to elect Mr.&nbsp;Darman to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Mr.&nbsp;Sant, if elected by the shareholders, will
continue to serve as a director and Chairman Emeritus after the election of Mr.&nbsp;Darman as Chairman. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Directors
are also compensated for their service on AES committees. If serving as Chairman of a committee of the Board, the following compensation schedule applies: Chairman of the Financial Audit and
Special Committees &#150; $20,000 per year; Chairman of the Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees &#150; $10,000 per year; and Chairman of the Environment,
Safety and Social Responsibility Committee &#150; $5,000 per year.
Financial Audit Committee members receive an annual retainer of $10,000 per year, and Special Committee members receive an annual retainer of $10,000 per year. A Director receives $1,000 for each
committee meeting attended in person, and $500 for each committee meeting in which he or she participated by telephone conference. Mr.&nbsp;Sant did not receive any meeting fees for the various
committee meetings that he attended </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Board has four standing committees and a Special Committee, which met regularly in 2002. The four standing committees are the Financial Audit Committee, the Environment, Safety and Social
Responsibility Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Compensation Committee. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Financial Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors is responsible for the review and oversight of the Company's performance with respect to its financial responsibilities
and the integrity of the Company's accounting and reporting practices. The Audit Committee also selects the Company's independent auditors. The Audit Committee is composed of three
non-employee directors and operates under a written charter adopted and approved by the Board of Directors. Each Audit Committee member is independent as defined by NYSE listing standards.
The Audit Committee met eleven times in 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Environment, Safety and Social Responsibility Committee monitors the environmental and safety compliance, respectively, of the Company and its subsidiaries and reviews and approves the scope of
the Company's internal environmental and safety compliance audit programs to consider the adequacy and appropriateness of the programs being planned and performed, as well as periodically reviews the
Company's commitment to, and implementation of, its principle to act in a socially responsible way. The Environment, Safety and Social Responsibility Committee met twice in 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides recommendations for potential nomination for election of new members of the Board of Directors, establishes compensation for directors, and
also considers governance issues relating to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers potential nominations provided by stockholders and submits suggested
nominations, when appropriate, to the Board of Directors for approval. Stockholders wishing to recommend persons for consideration by this Committee as nominees for election to the Company's Board of
Directors can do so by writing to the Secretary of the Company at 1001 North 19th Street, Arlington, Virginia 22209, giving each such person's name, biographical data and qualifications. Any such
recommendation should be accompanied by a written statement from the person recommended of his or her consent to be named as a nominee and, if nominated and elected, to serve as a director. The
Company's By-Laws also contain a procedure for stockholder nomination of directors. (See "Submission of Stockholder Proposals and Nominations" below.)
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met five times in 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Compensation Committee establishes rates of salary, bonuses, profit sharing contributions, grants of stock options, retirement and other compensation for officers of AES and for such other people
as the Board may designate. The Compensation Committee is composed of three non-employee Directors. All of the members of this committee are "disinterested persons" under the provisions of
Rule&nbsp;16b-3 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Compensation Committee's primary responsibility is to formulate and maintain the
compensation program of the Company in order to develop, retain (and attract, when necessary) people important to the Company's performance. This committee specifically acts to evaluate the
performance and set the total compensation for </FONT></P>

the executive officers of the Company, including the CEO, in accordance with the guidelines discussed below. This committee has delegated to the CEO the power to set compensation for the
non-executive officers. The Compensation Committee met four times in 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Special Committee was formed on September&nbsp;4, 2002 to facilitate communications between the Board and management of the Company in connection with the turnaround efforts faced by the Company
and is available to provide advice and assistance to Company management on a more frequent basis than the regularly scheduled meetings of the Board. The Special Committee met seven times in 2002. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company, not the Audit Committee nor the independent auditor, is responsible for the preparation of its financial statements and its operating results and for the appropriate safekeeping of the
Company's assets. The independent auditor's responsibility is to attest to the fair presentation of the financial statements. The independent auditor is accountable to the Audit Committee, and the
Audit Committee have the ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the independent auditor. The role of the Audit Committee is to be satisfied that both
the Company and the independent auditor discharge their respective responsibilities effectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Audit Committee held eleven meetings during fiscal 2002. The meetings were designed, among other things, to facilitate and encourage communication among the Audit Committee, the Company, and the
Company's independent auditors, Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP. The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits, and met
with the independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations and their evaluations of the Company's internal controls. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2002 with management and Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Audit Committee also discussed with the independent auditors matters required to be discussed with audit committees under generally accepted auditing standards, including, among other things,
matters related to the conduct of the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No.&nbsp;61, Communication
with Audit Committees, as amended by Statement on Auditing Standards No.&nbsp;90, Audit Committee Communications. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company's independent auditors also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by Independence Standards Board Standard No.&nbsp;1, Independence Discussions
with Audit Committees, and discussed with the Audit Committee their independence from the Company. When considering Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP's independence, the Audit Committee considered whether
their provision of services to the Company beyond those rendered in connection with their audit and review of the Company's consolidated financial statements was compatible with maintaining their
independence. The Audit Committee also reviewed, among other things, the amount of fees paid to Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP for audit and non-audit services. (Please see Principal
Accounting Firm Fees chart located in the section of the Proxy marked, "General".) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION&nbsp;COMMITTEE&nbsp;ON EXECUTIVE&nbsp;COMPENSATION  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Responsibilities
of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors include establishing policies governing the compensation of officers of AES. The Committee is composed of
three non-employee Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Committee's principal objective in establishing compensation policies is to develop and administer a comprehensive program designed to attract and retain outstanding managers. The policies are
designed to encourage such managers to make career commitments to AES and to accomplish AES's short and long-term business objectives. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Compensation Committee's guidelines for compensation of executive officers are designed to provide fair and competitive levels of total compensation, while integrating pay with performance.
Executive officers are evaluated annually for performance according to individual responsibilities and contributions, as well as broader measures related to corporate performance. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>There
are three elements of AES executive officer compensation (these elements are the same for most employees in the company): Base Salary, Annual Bonus, and Long-Term Compensation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Committee's guideline for each component of compensation is to provide compensation that is generally consistent with the Committee's interpretation of competitive compensation averages for
individuals with similar responsibilities at companies with similar financial and operating characteristics. Comparisons are made with published amounts, where available, and, from time to time, the
Company also participates in various industry-sponsored compensation surveys in addition to the 2002 consultant review described below. Because individual compensation is determined in part by
experience and performance, actual compensation may vary from industry averages. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Base
Salary is adjusted annually by the Committee to account for general economic and cost of living changes. Also, adjustments are made periodically to recognize significant new or additional
responsibilities of individual executive officers. In 2002, the Committee engaged an independent compensation consultant to review the level and mix of executive officer compensation and to assist the
Company in the redesign of the Company's Long-Term Compensation policy. Based in part on this review, the Committee established guidelines for suggested ranges of Base Salary, Annual
Bonus, and Long-Term Compensation for eligible participants between the 25<SUP>th</SUP> to 75<SUP>th</SUP> percentiles of similar companies. Based on these guidelines, the Committee
adjusted Base Salaries to be competitive with the information contained in the review performed (in 2002) by the independent consultant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Annual
Bonuses were reevaluated in 2002 to emphasize specific corporate performance targets. In 2002, bonuses were based 50&nbsp;percent </FONT></P>

on meeting business or corporate cash flow targets, 25&nbsp;percent on meeting cost-cutting targets, and 25&nbsp;percent on other goals such as leadership, values, or an officer's
business performance with respect to his or her functional area. Targeted ranges for Annual Bonus for different officer job categories or functions were determined from benchmark industry data. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Executive
officers also participate in the Company's profit sharing plan (or deferred compensation plan for executive officers) on the same terms as all other people in the Company, subject to any
legal limitations on amounts that may be contributed or benefits that may be payable under the plan. Matching contributions and annual profit sharing contributions are made with the Common Stock of
the Company to further encourage long-term performance. In addition, certain individuals of the Company participate in the Company's supplemental retirement plan, which provides
supplemental retirement benefits to "highly compensated employees" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) of an amount which would be contributed
on such individual's behalf under the profit sharing plan (or the deferred compensation plan for executive officers) but is not so contributed because of the limitations contained in the Internal
Revenue Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
most cases, the Committee has taken steps to qualify income paid to any executive officer as a deductible business expense pursuant to regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service under
Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to qualifying compensation paid to executive officers in excess of $1&nbsp;million. The Committee will continue to consider the
implications to the Company of qualifying all compensation as a deductible expense under Section&nbsp;162 (m), but retains the discretion to pay bonuses commensurate with an executive officer's
contributions to the success of the Company, irrespective of whether such amounts are entirely deductible. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>NEW LONG-TERM COMPENSATION PLAN  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company's proposed 2003 Long-Term Compensation Plan ("2003 LTC Plan") is intended to replace the award of stock options provided under previous AES compensation programs. For 2003,
long-term compensation awards ("LTCA") under the 2003 LTC Plan are proposed to be a mix of stock options and "Performance Units" (cash bonuses with payout tied to long-term
company performance). Payout under the Performance Units granted for 2003 will not be made until the year 2005. Payout will be made at that time only if certain business targets have been reached for
the period 2003-2005. This proposed change is designed to create a balanced long-term compensation plan by tying a portion of the long-term compensation to stock performance
and a portion to AES business performance, thereby providing individuals with incentives that have a more comprehensive link to long-term value creation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Targeted
long-term compensation levels under the 2003 LTC Plan for each individual will be awarded annually based on competitive market pay levels for each job category and an individual's
specific job performance. LTCA under the 2003 LTC Plan will contain stock-based awards and Performance Units, in percentages based on the Committee's recommendations. The Committee is considering
introducing restricted stock to the stock portion for LTCA awarded in the year 2004 and years thereafter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Under
the terms of the 2003 LTC Plan, Performance Units will have an initial value of $1, and will be valued at the end of the performance period (three years) from $0 to $2.00, depending on
performance. (If the participant achieves target performance, each performance unit is worth $1.00; if the participant achieves less than 90% of the target performance, each performance unit will be

more of the target performance, each performance unit will be worth $2.00.) The 2003 Performance Units will be tied to the Company's performance as measured by "Cash Value Added" ("CVA"). CVA is
equal to AES operating cash flow minus a charge for incremental (new) capital used by AES businesses. The Company has calculated a target CVA for AES as a whole based on budget and corporate model
forecasts. A participant's receipt of the LTCA will be dependent upon actual performance compared to this CVA target
over a three-year period (2003-2005). Using CVA as a performance measure is consistent with the Company's focus on increasing operating cash flow of AES businesses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company anticipates that a new award of Performance Units will be granted annually. Any payout under such annual Performance Units will occur three years after the date of the grant and will be
contingent upon a specific three year business target being met at the end of the three year performance period, with that three year target being set at the time of the grant of the annual
Performance Units award. </FONT></P>

<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Performance Unit Awards in 2003    <BR>  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no performance units granted for 2002. The Company, however, has granted for fiscal year 2003 Performance Units pursuant to a proposed new Long-Term
Compensation plan which is tied to the actual future performance of the Company. The proposed new Long-Term Compensation plan is discussed in the Report of the Compensation Committee on Executive
Compensation set forth above. To further explain the shift in compensation philosophy regarding long-term compensation, the table set forth below is included for illustrative purposes to show the
target performance units granted to named executive officers for 2003. The awards cover the 2003-2005 performance period and were granted under the proposed 2003 Long-Term
Compensation Plan. Payout under the Performance Units granted for 2003 will not be made until the year 2005. Payout will be made at that time only if certain business targets have been reached for the
period 2003-2005. The 2003 Performance Units are tied to the Company's performance as measured by "Cash Value Added" ("CVA"). CVA is equal to AES operating cash flow minus a charge for incremental
(new) capital used by AES businesses. Participants will be paid for actual performance compared to these targets over a three-year period. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Company anticipates that a new award of Performance Units will be granted annually. Any payout under such annual Performance Units will occur three years after the date of the grant
and will be contingent upon a specific three year business target being met at the end of the three year performance period, with that three year target being set at the time of the grant of the
annual Performance Units award. </FONT></P>

Employment Agreements shall automatically be extended for one additional year unless, no later than the date which is six (6)&nbsp;months prior to the renewal date, the Company or the individual
provides notice of an intent not to extend the term. Each of the Employment Agreements provides a respective base salary amount. Mr.&nbsp;Hanrahan also is eligible for an annual bonus with a target
of (150%) of his base salary; Mr.&nbsp;Ruggirello and Mr.&nbsp;Sharp are eligible for an annual bonus with a target of (105%) of their respective base salary; and Mr.&nbsp;Luraschi is eligible

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>APPROVAL OF THE AES CORPORATION 2003 LONG-TERM COMPENSATION PLAN  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Board of Directors has unanimously adopted The AES Corporation 2003 Long-Term Compensation Plan (the "2003 LTC Plan"), subject to shareholder approval. To this end, the 2003 LTC Plan
is being submitted to shareholders for approval so that certain awards granted under the 2003 LTC Plan may qualify as "performance-based" compensation under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code ("Section&nbsp;162(m)"), and to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange Requirements. Section&nbsp;162(m) generally limits to $1&nbsp;million the annual corporate federal income
tax deduction for compensation paid to the chief executive officer or any of the four other highest paid officers of a publicly held corporation, unless such compensation is performance-based. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Summary of the 2003 LTC Plan  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
following summary description of the 2003 LTC Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2003 LTC Plan, which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix&nbsp;B.
The parenthetical section references that follow refer to sections of the 2003 LTC Plan that relate to the summary description provided. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Purpose</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The purpose of the 2003 LTC Plan is to (i)&nbsp;reward full-time or part-time employees of AES or its affiliates,
including those individuals to whom an offer of employment has been extended (each an "Employee"), by means of appropriate incentives for achieving long-range Company goals; (ii)&nbsp;to
provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies; (iii)&nbsp;to
further match Employees' financial interests with those of the Company's other shareholders through compensation that is based on the Company's common stock and thereby enhance the
long-term financial interest of the Company and its Affiliates, including through the growth in the value of the Company's equity and enhancement of long-term shareholder
return; and (iv)&nbsp;to facilitate recruitment and retention of outstanding personnel eligible to participate in the 2003 LTC Plan. (Section&nbsp;1) </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Administration</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. The 2003 LTC Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board, or any successor committee thereto, or another
committee of the Board appointed or designated by the Board (the "Committee"). Subject to the terms of the 2003 LTC Plan, the Committee may make awards under the 2003 LTC Plan; determine when and to
whom awards will be granted, the types of awards and the number of shares of Common Stock ("Shares") covered by the awards; establish the terms, conditions, performance criteria, restrictions, and
other provisions of such awards and cancel or suspend awards. The Committee may delegate its authority subject to certain limitations. (Section&nbsp;3(a) and (i)) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Settlement of Awards.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall have authority under the 2003 LTC Plan to determine whether, to what extent and under what
circumstances awards under the 2003 LTC Plan may be settled, paid or exercised in cash, Shares or other awards under the 2003 LTC Plan or other property, or canceled, forfeited or suspended.
(Section&nbsp;3(d)) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Interpretation and Operation.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall have the authority to interpret the 2003 LTC Plan and any award or agreement made under
the 2003 LTC Plan, to establish, amend, waive and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the administration of the 2003 LTC Plan, to determine the terms and provisions of any agreements entered
under the 2003 LTC Plan (not inconsistent with the 2003 LTC Plan), and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2003 LTC Plan. The Committee may correct

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Deferral of Awards.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances cash, Shares, other securities,
other awards under the 2003 LTC Plan, other property, and other amounts payable with respect to an award under the 2003 LTC Plan shall be deferred either automatically, or at the election of the
holder thereof, or of the Committee. (Section&nbsp;3(f)) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;162(m).</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the terms of the 2003 LTC Plan, the Committee will have the authority and discretion to determine the
extent to which awards under the 2003 LTC Plan will be structured to conform to the requirements applicable to performance-based compensation as described in Section&nbsp;162(m), and to take such
action, establish such procedures, and impose such restrictions at the time such awards are granted as the Committee determines to be necessary or appropriate to conform to such requirements.
(Section&nbsp;3(b)) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Shares Available.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to adjustment, the maximum number of Shares that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2003 LTC
Plan is 17,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the 2003 LTC Plan's adjustments provision (as described below), no eligible 2003 LTC Plan participant may receive stock options and
stock appreciation rights under the 2003 LTC Plan in any calendar year that relate to more than 1,000,000. (Section&nbsp;4(a)) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Shares
to be issued under the 2003 LTC Plan may be made available from authorized but unissued Common Stock, Common Stock held by the Company in its treasury, or Common Stock purchased by the Company
on the open market or otherwise. During the term of the 2003 LTC Plan, the Company will at all times reserve and keep available the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be sufficient to satisfy
the requirements of the 2003 LTC Plan. (Section&nbsp;4(b)) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>If
any Shares covered by an award (other than a Substitute Award as defined below), or to which such an award relates, terminate, lapse or are forfeited or cancelled, or such an award is otherwise

termination, lapse, cancellation, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>etc</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>., shall again be, or shall become available for issuance under the 2003 LTC Plan. Shares underlying Substitute
Awards shall not reduce the number of Shares available for delivery under the 2003 LTC Plan. A "Substitute Award" under the 2003 LTC Plan is any award granted in assumption of, or in substitution for,
an outstanding award previously granted by a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines (Sections 2 and 4(c) and (d)) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All full-time or part-time employees (including an officer or director who is also an employee) of the
Company or an affiliate of the Company are eligible to participate in the 2003 LTC Plan. Other than for awards of Incentive Stock Options (as described below), any individual or individuals to whom an
offer of employment has been extended may also receive awards under the 2003 LTC Plan at the discretion of the Committee. Holders of equity-based awards issued by a company acquired by the Company or
with which the Company combines are eligible to receive Substitute Awards under the 2003 LTC Plan. Currently, approximately 30,150 employees are eligible for awards under the 2003 LTC Plan. (Sections
2 and 5) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Grant of Awards.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may grant the following four types of awards under the 2003 LTC Plan: (i)&nbsp;Options,

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Options.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Option is an option to purchase one share of Common Stock. The Committee may grant either an Incentive Stock Option or a
Non-Qualified Stock Option. An Incentive Stock Option is an Option that meets the requirements of Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto. A
Non-Qualified Stock Option is an Option that is not an Incentive Stock Option. The Committee may grant Options with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and
conditions, in either case not inconsistent with the provisions of the 2003 LTC Plan, as the Committee may determine: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The

term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee and the effect thereon, if any, of the termination of employment by the holder of such Option shall be determined
by the Committee and set forth in the applicable agreement under the 2003 LTC Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
Option may be exercised at any time during the period commencing with either the date that Option is granted or the first date permitted under a vesting schedule
established by the Committee and ending with the expiration date of the Option. A 2003 LTC Plan participant may exercise his Option for all or part of the number of Shares which he is eligible to
exercise under terms of the Option. The Committee shall determine the method or methods by which, and the form or forms in which, including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other Awards, or other
property, or any combination thereof, having a fair market value on the exercise date equal to the relevant exercise price, payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Restricted Stock.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Award of Restricted Stock consists of Shares and an Award of Restricted Stock Units consists of contractual rights
denominated in Shares, each of which represents a right to receive the value of a Share (or a percentage of such value, which percentage may be higher than 100%). Shares and Restricted Stock Units
underlying such Awards are subject to restrictions and such other terms and conditions as the Committee may determine, which restrictions and such other terms and conditions may lapse separately or in
combination at such time or times, in such installments or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate. If the vesting conditions applicable to an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock
Units relate exclusively to the passage of time and continued employment or provision of services, or refraining therefrom, such time period shall consist of not less than 36&nbsp;months, except
that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to such Awards if they are made in satisfaction of Company obligations to employees that would otherwise be paid in cash, are issued in connection with
the exercise of a stock option or other award under the 2003 LTC Plan or are Substitute Awards. (7(a)) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Other Stock-Based Awards.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may from time to time grant to eligible participants of the 2003 LTC Plan such other Awards
(including, without limitation, stock appreciation rights and rights to dividends and dividend equivalents) that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise
based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares) as are deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the 2003 LTC Plan. Subject to
the terms of the 2003 LTC Plan, the Committee shall determine the terms
and conditions of such Awards. Shares or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted as Other Stock-Based Awards shall be purchased for such consideration, which may be paid by
such method or methods and in such form or forms, including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, or other property, or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall
determine, the value of which consideration, as established by the Committee, shall, except in the case of substitute Awards, not be less than the fair market value of such Shares or other securities
as of the date such purchase right is granted. (Section&nbsp;8) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Performance Awards.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Performance Award (also known as a Performance Unit) is an Award under the 2003 LTC Plan that the Committee intends

employee" as defined in Section&nbsp;162(m) for the tax year of the Company with regard to which a deduction in respect of such person's Award would be allowed and (ii)&nbsp;the recipient of

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Summary of Tax Aspects of 2003 LTC Plan  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
following discussion is a brief summary of the principal United States Federal income tax consequences under current Federal income tax laws relating to awards under the 2003 LTC Plan. This
summary is not intended to be exhaustive and, among other things, does not describe state, local or foreign income and other tax consequences. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Non-Qualified Stock Options ("NQSO").</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An optionee will not recognize any taxable income upon the grant of an NQSO and the
Company will not be entitled to a tax deduction with respect to the grant of an NQSO. Upon exercise of an NQSO, the excess of the fair market value of the Stock on the exercise date over the option
exercise price will be taxable as compensation income to the optionee and will be subject to applicable withholding taxes. The Company will generally be entitled to a tax deduction at such time in the
amount of such compensation income. The optionee's tax basis for the Stock received pursuant to the exercise of an NQSO will equal the sum of the compensation income recognized and the exercise price. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
the event of a sale of Stock received upon the exercise of an NQSO, any appreciation or depreciation after the exercise date generally will be taxed as capital gain or loss and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such Stock is more than one year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Incentive Stock Options ("ISO").</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An optionee will not recognize any taxable income at the time of grant or timely exercise of an ISO and
the Company will not be entitled to a tax deduction with respect to such grant or exercise. Exercise of an ISO may, however, give rise to taxable compensation income subject to applicable withholding
taxes, and a tax deduction to the Company, if the ISO is not exercised on a timely basis (generally, while the optionee is employed by the Company or within 90&nbsp;days after termination of
employment) or if the optionee subsequently engages in a "disqualifying disposition," as described below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A
sale or exchange by an optionee of shares acquired upon the exercise of an ISO more than one year after the transfer of the shares to such optionee and more than two years after the date of grant of
the ISO will result in any difference between the net sale proceeds and the exercise price being treated as long-term capital gain (or loss) to the optionee. If such sale or exchange takes
place within two years after the date of grant of the ISO or within one year from the date of transfer of the ISO shares to the optionee, such sale or exchange will generally constitute a
"disqualifying disposition" of such shares that will have the following results: any excess of (i)&nbsp;the lesser of (a)&nbsp;the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise of the
ISO and (b)&nbsp;the amount realized on such disqualifying disposition of the shares over (ii)&nbsp;the option exercise price of such shares, will be ordinary income to the optionee, subject to
applicable withholding taxes, and the Company will be entitled to a tax deduction in the amount </FONT></P>

of such income. Any further gain or loss after the date of exercise generally will qualify as capital gain or loss and will not result in any deduction by the Company. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Restricted Stock.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> A grantee will not recognize any income upon the receipt of restricted stock unless the holder elects under Section&nbsp;83(b) of
the Code, within thirty days of such receipt, to recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the restricted stock at the time of receipt, less any amount paid for the
shares. If the election is made, the holder will not be allowed a deduction for amounts subsequently required to be returned to the Company. If the election is not made, the holder will generally
recognize ordinary income, on the date that the restrictions to which the restricted stock is subject are removed, in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares on such date, less any
amount paid for the shares. At the time the holder recognizes ordinary income, the Company generally will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>Generally,
upon a sale or other disposition of restricted stock with respect to which the holder has recognized ordinary income (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, a
Section&nbsp;83(b) election was previously made or the restrictions were
previously removed), the holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on such sale or other disposition and the holder's basis in such
shares. Such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such shares is more than one year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Restricted Stock Units and Performance Awards.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant of an Award of Restricted Stock Units or a Performance Award will not result in
income for the grantee or in a tax deduction for the Company. Upon the settlement of such an Award, the grantee will recognize ordinary income equal to the aggregate value of the payment received, and
the Company generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in the same amount. </FONT></P>

For information on option grants to named executive officers in 2003, please see footnote 2 of the Summary Compensation Table on page&nbsp;13 of this proxy statement which sets forth the option
awards to each of the named executive officers for fiscal 2003 under The AES Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan. Also, all executive officers as a group (9 persons) received options relating to a
total number of 3,964,455 Shares under The AES Corporation 2001 Stock Option plan for fiscal 2003. Other than option awards, our executives and employees have not previously received awards of
restricted stock or restricted stock units, other stock-based awards or performance awards. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
AES Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors (the "2001 Director Plan"), eligible participants being any director of the Company who is not an employee of AES or any of its
affiliates, encourages and promotes the growth and prosperity of AES by helping to attract, retain and reward outside directors or AES with equitable and competitive compensation opportunities and by
sharing in the stock ownership of AES. The Board of Directors has adopted certain amendments to the
2001 Director Plan, subject to stockholder approval at the forthcoming Annual Meeting. The stockholders will vote at the forthcoming Annual Meeting on a proposal to (i)&nbsp;permit the Board of
Directors at its sole discretion to grant a one-time option to each outside director elected or appointed lead outside director and/or non-executive Chairman of the Board of
Directors as of the date of such election or appointment to purchase up to 300,000 shares of Common Stock and (ii)&nbsp;increase the maximum aggregate number of shares for which options may be
granted under the 2001 Director Plan from 750,000 shares of Common Stock to 2,750,000 shares of Common Stock. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>There
follows a brief description of the principal features of the 2001 Director Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Shares Available for Future Grants.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;12, 2003, the Board of Directors approved and adopted an amendment to the 2001
Director Plan, subject to stockholder approval at the forthcoming Annual Meeting, to provide for the grant of options to purchase up to a total number of 2,750,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to
the 2001 Director Plan, subject to adjustment for any merger or other corporation transaction or event as described below under "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Recapitalization</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>".
Prior to such amendment, the maximum number of shares underlying the options available for grant under the 2001 Director Plan was 750,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>AES
will reserve, either from authorized but unissued Common Stock or from Common Stock reacquired by AES and held in its treasury, the full number of shares of Common Stock necessary to satisfy all
options that may be granted under the 2001 Director Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Administration.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors will administer the 2001 Director Plan. Subject to the provisions of the 2001 Director Plan and such

any and all questions arising under the 2001 Director Plan. The determination of the Board of Directors will be binding and conclusive on all persons. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any director of AES who is not an employee of AES or any of its affiliates will be eligible to participate in the 2001
Director Plan. Currently, eleven directors are eligible for awards under the 2001 Director Plan and only one director is eligible to receive a Lead Option (as defined below). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Awards.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options may be granted under the 2001 Director Plan in accordance with the policies established by the Board of Directors from time

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
addition, on February&nbsp;12, 2003, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the 2001 Director Plan, subject to approval by the stockholders at the forthcoming Annual Meeting, to permit
the Board of Directors in its sole discretion to grant an option to purchase up to 300,000 shares of Common Stock to any outside director elected or appointed lead outside director and/or
non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors as of the date of such election or appointment (a "Lead Option"). The Board of Directors, subject to stockholder approval of the
immediately above referenced amendment to the 2001 Director Plan, has granted to Richard Darman a Lead Option effective as of February&nbsp;12, 2003 to purchase 300,000 shares of Common Stock with
an exercise price per share of Common Stock equal to $2.75 per share, the quoted market price of the Company's Common Stock on December&nbsp;3, 2002, the date on which Mr.&nbsp;Darman accepted the
position of Lead Independent Director. If the amendment is approved, Mr.&nbsp;Darman's one-time grant shall vest and become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year. If Mr.&nbsp;Darman
is elected by the AES stockholders to serve as a Director of AES, the Board expects to vote to elect Mr.&nbsp;Darman to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Mr.&nbsp;Sant, if elected by the
shareholders, will continue to serve as a director and Chairman Emeritus after the election of Mr.&nbsp;Darman as Chairman. </FONT></P>

as of February&nbsp;12, 2003, subject to shareholder approval, the Board of Directors granted to Richard Darman a Lead Option to purchase 300,000 shares of Common Stock with an exercise
price per share of Common Stock at $2.75 per share, the quoted market price of the Company's Common Stock on December&nbsp;3, 2002, the date on which Mr.&nbsp;Darman was appointed Lead Independent
Director. Mr.&nbsp;Darman's Lead Option will vest and become exercisable at the rate of 25% per year. Mr.&nbsp;Darman's Lead Option will expire on February&nbsp;11, 2013, ten years from its
grant date. The fair market value of a share of AES Common Stock as of March&nbsp;14, 2003 was $3.12. </FONT></P>

director group received (i)&nbsp;Annual Option grants totaling 35,190 shares, with an exercise price per share of Common Stock equal to $7.91 per share, (ii)&nbsp;Alternative Option grants
totaling 36,552 shares, with an exercise price per share of Common Stock equal to $7.91per share, and (iii)&nbsp;two Initial Option Grants totaling 134,278 shares, with exercise price per share of

By-Laws contain a procedure for stockholder nomination of directors. The By-Laws provide that any record owner of stock entitled to be voted generally in the election of
directors may nominate one or more persons for election as a director at a stockholders meeting only if written notice is given to the Secretary of AES of the intent to make such nomination. The
notice must be given, with respect to an annual meeting, not later than 90&nbsp;days in advance of such annual meeting and with respect to a special meeting, not later than the close of business on
the seventh day following the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the date on which notice of such special meeting is first given to stockholders and (b)&nbsp;the date on which a public announcement of such
meeting is first made. Each notice must include (i)&nbsp;the name and address of each stockholder who intends to appear in person or by proxy to make the nomination and of the person or persons to
be nominated; (ii)&nbsp;a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming them) pursuant to which the nomination is
to be made by the stockholder; (iii)&nbsp;such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would have been included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;14a-8 under the Exchange Act; and (iv)&nbsp;the consent of each nominee to serve if elected. The presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of
any person not made in compliance with this procedure. The procedure for stockholder nomination of directors described above may have the effect of precluding a nomination for election of directors at
a particular meeting if the required procedure is not followed. </FONT></P>

of the service. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses auditor independence, and this framework is consistent with the provisions of the Act. No services were approved after the fact by the

regulatory requirements; and prepare the audit committee report that Securities and Exchange Commission rules require to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Membership  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee shall consist of at least three members, comprised solely of independent directors meeting the independence and experience requirements of
Section&nbsp;10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the rules promulgated thereunder and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. </FONT></P>

service to be provided by the Company's independent auditors. The Audit Committee may consult with management in the decision making process, buy may not delegate this authority to management. The
Audit Committee may, from time to time, delegate its authority to approve non-audit services on a preliminary basis to one or more Audit Committee members, provided that such designees present any
such approvals to the full Audit Committee at the next Audit Committee meeting. </FONT></P>

right to vote Shares underlying Restricted Stock Awards or the right to receive any dividend, other right or property), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or times,
in such installments or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate. If the vesting conditions applicable to an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units relate exclusively to the
passage of time and continued employment or provision of services, or refraining therefrom, such time period shall consist of not less than 36&nbsp;months, except that the foregoing restriction
shall not apply to such Awards if they (i)&nbsp;are made in satisfaction of Company obligations to employees that would otherwise be paid in cash, (ii)&nbsp;are issued in connection with the
exercise of an Option or other Award hereunder, or (iii)&nbsp;are Substitute Awards. </FONT></P>

Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including, without limitation,
book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates. In the event any stock certificate is issued in respect of Shares underlying a Restricted Stock Award, such
certificate shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Shares. </FONT></P>

rights to dividends and dividend equivalents) that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without
limitation, securities convertible into Shares) as are deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee shall determine the terms
and conditions of such Awards. Shares or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted under this Section&nbsp;8 shall be purchased for such consideration, which may be paid by
such method or methods and in such form or forms, including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, or other property, or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall
determine, the value of which consideration, as established by the Committee, shall, except in the case of Substitute Awards, not be less than the Fair Market Value of such Shares or other securities
as of the date such purchase right is granted. </FONT></P>
