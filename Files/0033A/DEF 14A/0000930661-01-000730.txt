                                                                 March 23, 2001

   A proxy in the accompanying form is solicited by the Board of Directors of
TXU Corp. for use at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in the
Dallas Ballroom of the Conference Center of the Adam's Mark Hotel, 400 North
Olive Street, Dallas, Texas on Friday, May 11, 2001 at 9:30 a.m. and any
adjournments thereof for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice.

   The close of business on March 12, 2001 has been fixed as the time as of
which shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote with respect to, this
meeting shall be determined. At such date there were outstanding and entitled
to vote 258,129,397 shares of common stock. Except as indicated below, each
share is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to shareholders.

   Any shareholder may exercise the right of cumulative voting in the election
of directors provided the shareholder gives written notice of such intention
to the Secretary of the Company on or before the date preceding the election.
When exercising this right the shareholder is entitled to one vote for each
share held multiplied by the number of directors to be elected and may cast
all such votes for a single nominee or spread such votes among the nominees in
any manner desired.

   This Notice, Proxy Statement and form of proxy are being mailed or given to
shareholders on or about March 23, 2001. Since the Summary Annual Report for
2000 contains abbreviated financial information, the audited consolidated
financial statements and certain other financial information of the Company
are included in Appendix B to this Proxy Statement.

   The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to
use of the mails, proxies may be solicited by directors, officers and regular
employees of the Company in person or by telephone. The Company has hired D.
F. King & Co. to assist in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated cost of
$8,000 plus disbursements. Shareholders may assist the Company in avoiding
expenses in this connection by returning their proxies promptly.

   Any proxy delivered pursuant to this solicitation is revocable at the
option of the person executing the same at any time prior to the exercise
thereof. The shares represented by any proxy duly given as a result of this
request will be voted in the discretion of the persons named in the proxy
unless the shareholder specifies a choice by means of the ballot space on the
proxy, in which case the shares will be voted accordingly.

   The Company has adopted a confidential voting policy. Accordingly,
tabulation of proxies and votes cast at the meeting will be conducted by an
independent agent and the votes of individual shareholders will be kept
private and not disclosed to the Company, except in limited circumstances.

                                       1
<PAGE>

   The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the
shares of the common stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum entitled
to transact business at the meeting. Directors are elected by plurality vote
of the votes cast at the meeting; abstentions and non-votes, as described
below, will have no effect. The approval of the selection of auditors requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting;
abstentions and non-votes, i.e. shares held by brokers and other nominees or
fiduciaries that are present at the meeting but not voted on such matter, will
be treated as negative votes.

                  2002 ANNUAL MEETING SHAREHOLDERS' PROPOSALS

   All proposals from shareholders to be considered at the next annual meeting
scheduled for May 17, 2002 must be received by the Secretary of the Company,
1601 Bryan Street, Dallas, Texas 75201-3411, not later than the close of
business on November 23, 2001.

   In addition, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission allow the
Company to use discretionary voting authority to vote on any matter coming
before the 2002 annual meeting of shareholders that is not included in the
proxy statement for that meeting if the Company does not have notice of the
matter by February 6, 2002.

                             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

   It is the intent of the Board of Directors that the persons named in the
proxy will vote your shares in favor of the nominees for directors listed
hereafter, unless authority is withheld. All of the nominees are current
members of the Board of Directors. The persons named in the proxy may cumulate
the votes represented thereby and in case any such nominee shall become
unavailable, which the Board of Directors has no reason to anticipate, may
vote for a substitute.

   The names of the nominees for the office of director for the ensuing year
and information about them, as furnished by the nominees themselves, are set
forth below:

   During 2000 the Board of Directors held five meetings. The standing
committees of the Board of Directors and the membership of each committee are
shown on the preceding pages. During 2000 each of the Directors attended more
than 96% of the aggregate of the Board of Directors meetings and the meetings
of the Committees on which they serve.

   The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its
oversight responsibilities applicable to the Company's auditing, accounting
and financial reporting processes and the Company's system of internal
control. The Committee has developed, and the Board of Directors has adopted,
a written charter which is reproduced in Appendix A to this proxy statement.
The Audit Committee held five meetings during 2000.

   The Executive Committee exercises the authority of the Board in the
intervals between meetings of the Board. The Executive Committee held one
meeting during 2000.

   The Finance Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, for its
consideration, major financial undertakings and policies and performs such
other duties as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Board. The
Finance Committee held four meetings during 2000.

   The Nominating Committee selects and recommends to the Board, for its
consideration, persons as nominees for election as directors of the Company
and performs such other duties as may be assigned to it from time to time by
the Board. The Nominating Committee held one meeting in 2000. Shareholders may
recommend nominees for directors to the Nominating Committee by writing to the
Secretary of the Company, 1601 Bryan Street, Dallas, Texas 75201-3411.

   The Nuclear Committee reviews, generally oversees, and makes reports and
recommendations to the Board in connection with the operation of the Company's
nuclear generating units. The Nuclear Committee held seven meetings during
2000.

   The Organization and Compensation Committee reviews and establishes the
duties, titles and remuneration of officers of the Company. The Organization
and Compensation Committee held five meetings in 2000.

   The Business Development Committee reviews and recommends to the Board, for
its consideration, new business opportunities, proposed acquisitions and other
transactions and performs such other duties as may be assigned to it from time
to time by the Board. The Business Development Committee held six meetings
during 2000.

   Except as described herein, directors were compensated in 2000 by a
retainer at the annual rate of $36,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting
attended and $1,000 for each Committee meeting attended. Effective July 1,
2000, the retainer for service on the Board was increased from an annual rate
of $30,000 to an annual rate of $36,000. Also effective July 1, 2000, the
annual retainers for service on the Nuclear Committee and the Business
Development Committee were established at $5,000 compared to the previous
retainers for service on such committees of $8,000 and $3,000, respectively.
Directors who are officers, or former officers, of the Company do not receive
any fees for service as a director. All directors are reimbursed for
reasonable expenses incurred in connection with their services as directors.

   Directors who receive a retainer for their service as a director may elect
to defer, in increments of 25%, all or a portion of their annual Board
retainer pursuant to the TXU Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors
(Directors' Plan). Amounts deferred are matched by the Company. Under the
Directors' Plan, a trustee purchases Company common stock with an amount of
cash equal to each

                                       5
<PAGE>

participant's deferred retainer and matching amount, and accounts are
established for each participant containing performance units equal to such
number of common shares. Directors' Plan investments, including reinvested
dividends, are restricted to Company common stock. On the expiration of the
applicable maturity period (not fewer than three nor more than ten years, as
selected by the participant) or upon death or disability while serving as a
director, the value of the participant's accounts is paid in cash based on the
then current value of the performance units.

   In lieu of the retainers and fees paid to other non-officer directors as
described herein, Mr. Bonham received annual compensation from the Company in
the amount of (Pounds)100,000 (approximately $149,310 based on 2000 year-end
foreign exchange rates), under the terms of an agreement which also provides
for administrative support, transportation expenses and health insurance. This
agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon three-months'
notice.

   In addition to the retainers and fees described herein, Mr. Laday provides
consulting services to the Company under an agreement which provides for a
monthly retainer of $12,000 as well as reimbursement of certain travel
expenses. The agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon 60-
days' written notice. Mr. Laday was paid $144,000 during 2000 under this
agreement.

   Mr. Farrington entered into a management transition agreement with the
Company pursuant to which he retired as an active employee of the Company in
May of 1998. Under the agreement, which expired on May 31, 2000, he provided
consulting services to the Company at an annual fee of $200,000 following his
retirement.

              BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY

   Each nominee for director and certain executive officers reported

     allow such units to be paid only in the form of cash, investments in such
     units create essentially the same investment stake in the performance of
     the Company's common stock as do investments in actual shares of common

   stock. Since he does not receive a retainer, Mr. Bonham is not eligible to
   participate in the Directors' Plan. Dr. Little will first be eligible to
   participate in the Directors' Plan for the Plan Year beginning July 1,
   2001.

(2)  Shares reported include 10,000 shares owned by Mr. Griffin's spouse as
     her separate property in which Mr. Griffin disclaims any beneficial
     ownership.

(3)  Shares reported include 200 shares owned by Mr. Perry's spouse as her
     separate property in which Mr. Perry disclaims any beneficial ownership.

(4)  Shares reported include 106,451 shares subject to stock options
     exercisable within sixty days of the record date.

   Except as noted, the named individuals have sole voting and investment
power for the shares of common stock reported as Beneficially Owned. Ownership
of such common stock by each individual director and executive officer and for
all directors and executive officers as a group constituted less than 1% of
the Company's outstanding shares.

   The Company has no knowledge of any person who beneficially owned more than
5% of the common stock of the Company as of December 31, 2000. Mellon Bank,
N.A. (Mellon), held as of such date, in its capacity as Trustee of the TXU
Thrift Plan (Thrift Plan), a total of 12,710,249 shares of the Company's
common stock, or 4.9% of the outstanding common shares, of which 8,050,253
shares, or 3.1% of the outstanding shares, have been allocated to Thrift Plan
participants' accounts. Thrift Plan participants are entitled to direct Mellon
as to how to vote shares allocated to their accounts, and Mellon disclaims
beneficial ownership of such allocated shares.

(1)  Amounts reported as Bonus in the Summary Compensation Table are
     attributable to the named officer's participation in the Annual Incentive
     Plan (AIP). Elected corporate officers of the Company and its
     participating subsidiaries with a title of Vice President or above are
     eligible to participate in the AIP. Under the terms of the AIP, target
     incentive awards ranging from 40% to 75% of base salary, and a maximum
     award of 100% of base salary, are established. The percentage of the
     target or the maximum actually awarded, if any, is dependent upon the
     attainment of per share net income goals established in advance by the
     Organization and Compensation Committee (Committee) as well as the
     Committee's evaluation of the participant's and the Company's
     performance. One-half of each award is paid in cash and is reflected as
     Bonus in the Summary Compensation Table. Payment of the remainder of the
     award is deferred and invested under the Deferred and Incentive
     Compensation Plan (DICP) discussed hereinafter in footnote (2).

(2)  Amounts reported as Restricted Stock Awards in the Summary Compensation
     Table are attributable to the named officer's participation in the
     Deferred and Incentive Compensation Plan (DICP). Elected corporate
     officers of the Company and its participating subsidiaries with the title

                                       8
<PAGE>

   of Vice President or above are eligible to participate in the DICP.
   Participants in the DICP may defer a percentage of their base salary not to
   exceed a maximum percentage determined by the Committee for each Plan year
   and in any event not to exceed 15% of the participant's base salary. Salary
   deferred under the DICP is included in amounts reported as Salary in the
   Summary Compensation Table. The Company makes a matching award (Matching
   Award) equal to 150% of the participant's deferred salary. In addition,
   one-half of any AIP award (Incentive Award) is deferred and invested under
   the DICP. The Matching Awards and Incentive Awards are subject to
   forfeiture under certain circumstances. Under the DICP, a trustee purchases
   Company common stock with an amount of cash equal to each participant's
   deferred salary, Matching Award and Incentive Award, and accounts are
   established for each participant containing performance units (Units) equal
   to such number of common shares. DICP investments, including reinvested
   dividends, are restricted to Company common stock, and the value of each
   unit credited to participants' accounts equals the value of a share of
   Company common stock. On the expiration of the applicable maturity period
   (three years for Incentive Awards and five years for deferred salary and
   Matching Awards), the values of the participants' accounts are paid in cash
   based upon the then current value of the Units; provided, however, that in
   no event will a participant's account be deemed to have a cash value which
   is less than the sum of such participant's deferred salary together with 6%
   per annum interest compounded annually. The maturity period is waived if
   the participant dies or becomes totally and permanently disabled and may be
   extended under certain circumstances.

   Incentive Awards and Matching Awards that have been made under the DICP are
   included under Restricted Stock Awards in the Summary Compensation Table
   for each of the last three years. As a result of these awards,
   undistributed Incentive Awards and Matching Awards made under the Plan in
   prior years, and dividends reinvested thereon, the number and market value
   at December 31, 2000 of such Units (each of which is equal to one share of
   common stock) held in the DICP accounts for Messrs. Nye, Gibbs, Biegler,
   Dickie and McNally were 62,925 ($2,788,364), 26,816 ($1,188,284), 24,705
   ($1,094,740), 17,888 ($792,662) and 23,723 ($1,051,225), respectively.

(3)  Amounts reported as LTIP payouts in the Summary Compensation Table are
     attributable to the vesting and distribution of performance based
     restricted stock awards under the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
     (LTICP) and the distribution during the year of earnings on salaries
     previously deferred under the DICP.

   The LTICP is a comprehensive, stock-based incentive compensation plan
   providing for discretionary grants of common stock-based awards, including
   restricted stock. Outstanding awards to named executive officers vest at
   the end of a three year performance period and provide for an ultimate
   award of from 0% to 200% of the number of shares initially awarded based on
   the Company's total return to shareholders over the three year period
   compared to the total return provided by the companies comprising the
   Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index. Dividends on the restricted stock
   are reinvested in Company common stock and are paid in cash upon release of
   the restricted shares. Based on the Company's total return to shareholders
   over the three year period ending March 31, 2000 compared to the returns
   provided by the companies comprising the Standard & Poor's Electric Utility
   Index, Messrs. Nye, Gibbs and McNally each received 50% of the restricted
   shares awarded in May of 1997, which stock was valued at $380,188, $86,406
   and $190,094, respectively.

   Amounts reported also include earnings distributed during the year on
   salaries previously deferred under the DICP for Messrs. Nye and Gibbs of
   $19,605 and $8,262, respectively.

                                       9
<PAGE>

   As a result of restricted stock awards under the LTICP, and reinvested
   dividends thereon, the number of shares of restricted stock and the value
   of such shares at December 31, 2000 held for Messrs. Nye, Gibbs, Biegler,
   Dickie and McNally were 147,396 ($6,531,485), 32,598 ($1,444,499), 29,539
   ($1,308,947), 23,468 ($1,039,926) and 47,853 ($2,120,486), respectively.

   As noted, salaries deferred under the DICP are included in amounts reported
   as Salary in the Summary Compensation Table. Amounts shown in the table
   below represent the number of shares purchased under the DICP with these
   deferred salaries for 2000 and the number of shares awarded under the
   LTICP:

(4)  Amounts reported as All Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation
     Table are attributable to the named officer's participation in certain
     plans and as otherwise described hereinafter in this footnote.

  Under the TXU Thrift Plan (Thrift Plan) all eligible employees of the
  Company and any of its participating subsidiaries may invest up to 16% of
  their regular salary or wages in common stock of the Company, or in a
  variety of selected mutual funds. Under the Thrift Plan, the Company
  matches a portion of an employee's contributions in an amount equal to 40%,
  50% or 60% (depending on the employee's length of service) of the first 6%
  of such employee's contributions. All matching amounts are invested in
  common stock of the Company. The amounts reported under All Other
  Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table include these matching
  amounts which, for Messrs. Nye, Gibbs, Biegler, Dickie and McNally were
  $6,120, $5,100, $6,120, $4,080 and $4,080, respectively, during 2000.

  The Company has a Salary Deferral Program (Program) under which each
  employee of the Company and its participating subsidiaries whose annual
  salary is equal to or greater than an amount established under the Program
  ($100,550 for the Program Year beginning April 1, 2000) may elect to defer
  a percentage of annual base salary, or any bonus or other special cash
  compensation for a period of seven years, for a period ending with the
  retirement of such employee, or for a combination thereof. Such deferrals
  may be up to a maximum of 50% of the employee's annual salary and/or 100%
  of the employee's bonus or other special cash compensation. The Company
  makes a matching award, subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances,
  equal to 100% of up to the first 8% of salary deferred under the Program.
  Salary and bonuses deferred under the Program are included in amounts
  reported under Salary and

                                      10
<PAGE>

  Bonus, respectively, in the Summary Compensation Table. Deferrals are
  credited with earnings or losses based on the performance of investment
  alternatives selected by each participant. At the end of the applicable
  maturity period, the trustee for the Program distributes the deferrals and
  the applicable earnings in cash. The distribution is in a lump sum if the
  applicable maturity period is seven years. If the retirement option is
  elected, the distribution is made in twenty annual installments. The
  Company is financing the retirement option portion of the Program through
  the purchase of corporate-owned life insurance on the lives of
  participants. The proceeds from such insurance are expected to allow the
  Company to fully recover the cost of the retirement option. During 2000,
  matching awards, which are included under All Other Compensation in the
  Summary Compensation Table, were made for Messrs. Nye, Gibbs, Biegler,
  Dickie and McNally in the amounts of $76,000, $43,000, $52,000, $47,333 and
  $37,333, respectively.

  Under the Company's Split-Dollar Life Insurance Program (Insurance
  Program), split-dollar life insurance policies are purchased for elected
  corporate officers of the Company and its participating subsidiaries with a
  title of Vice President or above, with a death benefit equal to four times
  their annual Insurance Program compensation. New participants vest in the
  policies issued under the Insurance Program over a six year period. The
  Company pays the premiums for these policies and has received a collateral
  assignment of the policies equal in value to the sum of all of its
  insurance premium payments. Although the Insurance Program is terminable at
  any time, it is designed so that if it is continued, the Company will fully
  recover all of the insurance premium payments it has made either upon the
  death of the participant or, if the assumptions made as to policy yield are
  realized, upon the later of fifteen years of participation or the
  participant's attainment of age sixty-five. During 2000, the economic
  benefit derived by Messrs. Nye, Gibbs, Biegler, Dickie and McNally from the
  term insurance coverage provided and the interest foregone on the remainder
  of the insurance premiums paid by the Company amounted to $135,981,
  $64,635, $38,804, $13,259 and $16,519, respectively.

  An amount of $71,227 is included in the All Other Compensation column of
  the Summary Compensation Table for Mr. McNally for 2000 representing
  additional compensation that the Company agreed to pay Mr. McNally incident
  to his employment with the Company in lieu of payments he would have
  received from a prior employer.

(5)  The amount reported for Mr. Gibbs as Other Annual Compensation for 2000
     represents income taxes paid on Mr. Gibbs' behalf in connection with an
     extended assignment in the United Kingdom which ended in 2000. Such taxes
     are associated with certain benefits provided by the Company under its
     standard expatriate policy.

(6)  The Company has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Nye,
     Dickie and McNally as hereinafter described in this footnote.

  Effective June 1, 2000, the Company entered into an employment agreement
  with Mr. Nye. The agreement provides for Mr. Nye's continued service,
  through June 1, 2004 (Term), as the Company's Chairman of the Board and

  for an annual bonus under the terms of the AIP, and minimum annual
  restricted stock awards of 40,000 shares under the LTICP. The agreement
  also provides for the funding of the retirement benefit to which Mr. Nye
  will be entitled under the Company's supplemental retirement plan in an
  amount determined in accordance with the standard formula under such plan.
  Additionally, the agreement entitles Mr. Nye to certain severance benefits
  in the event he is terminated without

                                      11

  annualized base salary and target bonus, or the total amount of base salary
  and bonuses he would have received for the remainder of the Term; a payment
  in lieu of foregone and forfeited incentive compensation; and health care
  benefits. The agreement also provides for compensation and benefits under
  certain circumstances following a change-in-control of the Company during

  annualized base salary and target bonus, or the total base salary and bonus
  he would have received for the remainder of the Term; a payment in lieu of
  foregone and forfeited incentive compensation; health care benefits and a
  tax gross-up payment to offset any excise tax which may result from such
  change-in-control payments.

  The Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Dickie effective
  April 12, 1999, which provides for a minimum annual base salary of $750,000
  through May 31, 2002, and a minimum annual incentive bonus equal to one-
  half of Mr. Dickie's then current annual base salary and minimum annual
  restricted stock awards of 10,000 shares under the LTICP for each of 1999,
  2000 and 2001. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Dickie is also
  entitled to certain retirement compensation, as well as severance benefits
  in the event of a termination of Mr. Dickie's employment without cause,
  including a payment equal to annual base salary and target bonus; a payment
  for otherwise forfeited incentive compensation; and health care benefits.
  The agreement also provides for compensation and benefits under certain
  circumstances following a change-in-control of the Company, including a
  payment equal to three times his annualized base salary and target bonus; a
  payment in lieu of foregone and forfeited incentive compensation; health
  care benefits; and a tax gross-up payment to offset any excise tax which
  may result from such change-in-control payments.

  The Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. McNally effective
  July 1, 2000. The employment agreement provides for the continued service
  by Mr. McNally through June 30, 2003 (Term). Under the terms of the
  agreement, Mr. McNally will, during the Term, be entitled to a minimum
  annual base salary of $500,000, eligibility for an annual bonus under the
  terms of the AIP, and minimum annual restricted stock awards of 20,000
  shares under the LTICP. Additionally, the agreement entitles Mr. McNally to
  certain severance benefits in the event he is terminated without cause
  during the Term, including a payment equal to the greater of his annualized
  base salary and target bonus, or the total amount of base salary and
  bonuses he would have received for the remainder of the Term; a payment in
  lieu of foregone and forfeited incentive compensation; and health care
  benefits. The agreement also provides for compensation and benefits under
  certain circumstances following a change-in-control of the Company during
  the Term, including a payment equal to the greater of three times his
  annual base salary and target bonus, or the total base salary and bonus he
  would have received for the remainder of the Term; a payment in lieu of
  foregone and forfeited incentive compensation; health care benefits and a
  tax gross-up payment to offset any excise tax which may result from such
  change-in-control payment.

   As a part of the acquisition of ENSERCH Corporation (predecessor by name
change to TXU Gas Company) in 1997, options to purchase the common stock of
ENSERCH which had been granted to various employees of ENSERCH were converted
into options to acquire common shares of the Company. The table below shows,
for each of the named officers, the information specified with respect to
exercised, exercisable and unexercisable options under all existing stock
option plans, converted into shares of the Company's common stock into which
such options became exercisable at the time of the ENSERCH acquisition.

   The Company and its subsidiaries maintain retirement plans (TXU Retirement
Plan) which are qualified under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (Code). Annual retirement benefits under the
traditional defined benefit formula of the TXU Retirement Plan, which applied
to each of the named officers, are computed as follows: for each year of
accredited service up to a total of 40 years, 1.3% of the first $7,800, plus
1.5% of the excess over $7,800, of the participant's average annual earnings
during his or her three years of highest earnings. Amounts reported under
Salary for the named officers in the Summary Compensation Table approximate
earnings as defined by the TXU Retirement Plan without regard to any
limitations imposed by the Code. Benefits paid under the TXU Retirement Plan
are not subject to any reduction for Social Security payments but are limited
by provisions of the Code. As of February 28, 2001, years of accredited
service under the TXU Retirement Plan for Messrs. Nye, Gibbs, Biegler, Dickie
and McNally were 38, 38, 3, 1 and 4, respectively.

   Before the ENSERCH acquisition, Mr. Biegler earned retirement benefits
under the Retirement and Death Benefit Program of 1969 of ENSERCH Corporation
and Participating Subsidiary Companies (ENSERCH Retirement Plan) which was
merged into, and became a part of, the TXU Retirement Plan effective December
31, 1997. In connection with this plan merger, the TXU Retirement Plan was
amended to provide that the retirement benefit of certain ENSERCH employees
will equal the sum of

                                      13
<PAGE>

(1) their accrued benefit under the ENSERCH Retirement Plan through the last
pay period of 1997 and (2) their accrued benefit under the TXU Retirement Plan
beginning with the first pay period of 1998; provided that the aggregate
retirement benefit earned under the traditional defined benefit plan formula
of the plans can be no less than the retirement benefit which would have been
earned had all service under the traditional defined benefit formula been
under the ENSERCH Retirement Plan. Mr. Biegler, whose employment with the
Company began August 5, 1997, is treated in a similar manner. Amounts reported
for Mr. Biegler under Salary and Bonus in the Summary Compensation Table
approximate earnings as defined by the ENSERCH Retirement Plan without regard
to any limitations imposed by the Code. Benefits paid under the ENSERCH
Retirement Plan are not subject to any reduction for Social Security payments
but are limited by provisions of the Code. As of February 28, 2001, Mr.
Biegler had 29 years of accredited service under the ENSERCH Retirement Plan
and, as noted, 3 years of accredited service under the TXU Retirement Plan.

   The Company's supplemental retirement plans (Supplemental Plan) provide for
the payment of retirement benefits which would otherwise be limited by the
Code or the definition of earnings in the TXU Retirement Plan or the ENSERCH
Retirement Plan, as applicable. Under the Supplemental Plan, retirement
benefits are calculated in accordance with the same formula used under the
applicable qualified plan, except that, with respect to calculating the
portion of the Supplemental Plan benefit attributable to service under the TXU
Retirement Plan, earnings also include AIP awards (50% of the AIP award is
reported under Bonus for the named officers in the Summary Compensation
Table). The tables set forth above illustrate the total annual benefit payable
at retirement under the TXU Retirement Plan and the ENSERCH Retirement Plan,
respectively, inclusive of benefits payable under the Supplemental Plan, prior
to any reduction for a contingent beneficiary option which may be selected by
participants.

                ORGANIZATION AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
                           ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

   The Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
(Committee) is responsible for reviewing and establishing the compensation of
the executive officers of the Company. The Committee consists of nonemployee
directors of the Company and is chaired by J. E. Oesterreicher. Prior to his
retirement from the Board in March, 2001, the Committee was chaired by James
A. Middleton. The Committee has directed the preparation of this report and
has approved its content and submission to the shareholders.

   As a matter of policy, the Committee believes that levels of executive
compensation should be based upon an evaluation of the performance of the
Company and its officers generally, as well as in comparison to persons with
comparable responsibilities in similar business enterprises. Compensation
plans should align executive compensation with returns to shareholders with
due consideration accorded to balancing both long-term and short-term
objectives. The overall compensation program should provide for an appropriate
and competitive balance between base salaries and performance-based annual and
long-term incentives. The Committee has determined that, as a matter of policy
to be implemented over time, the base salaries of the officers will be
established around the median, or 50th percentile, of the top ten electric
utilities in the United States, or other relevant market, and that
opportunities for total direct compensation (defined as the sum of base
salaries, annual incentives and long-term incentives) to reach the 75th
percentile, or above, of such market or markets will be provided through
performance-based incentive compensation plans. Such compensation principles
and practices have allowed, and should continue to allow, the Company to
attract, retain and motivate its key executives.

   In furtherance of these policies, a nationally recognized compensation
consultant has been retained since 1994 to assist the Committee in its
periodic reviews of compensation and benefits provided to officers. The
consultant's evaluations include comparisons to the largest utilities as well
as to general industry with respect both to the level and composition of
officers' compensation. The consultant's recommendations including the Annual
Incentive Plan, the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan and certain benefit
plans have generally been implemented. The Annual Incentive Plan, which was
first approved by the shareholders in 1995 and reapproved in 2000, is
generally referred to as the AIP and is described in this report and in
footnote 1 on page 8 of this proxy statement. The Long-Term Incentive
Compensation Plan, referred to as the Long-Term Plan or LTICP, was approved by
the shareholders in 1997 and is described in this report as well as in
footnote 3 on pages 9 and 10 of this proxy statement.

   The compensation of the officers of the Company consists principally of
base salaries, the opportunity to earn an incentive award under the AIP,
awards of performance-based restricted shares under the Long-Term Plan and the
opportunity to participate in the Deferred and Incentive Compensation Plan
(referred to as the DICP and described in footnote 2 on pages 8 and 9 of this
proxy statement). The value of future payments under the DICP, as well as the
value of the deferred

                                      15
<PAGE>

portion of any award under the AIP and the value of any awards of performance-
based restricted shares under the Long-Term Plan, are directly related to the
future performance of the Company's common stock. It is anticipated that
performance-based incentive awards under the AIP and the Long-Term Plan, will,
in future years, continue to constitute a substantial percentage of the
officers' total compensation.

   Certain of the Company's business units have developed separate annual and
long-term incentive compensation plans. Those plans focus on the results
achieved by those individual business units and the compensation opportunities
provided by those plans are considered to be competitive in the markets in
which those units compete. Generally, officers may not participate in both the
traditional incentive compensation plans as discussed herein and the business
unit plans. None of the named officers participate in the individual business
unit plans.

   The AIP is administered by the Committee and provides an objective
framework within which annual Company and individual performance can be
evaluated by the Committee. Depending on the results of such performance
evaluations, and the attainment of the per share net income goals established
in advance, the Committee may provide annual incentive compensation awards to
eligible officers. The evaluation of each individual participant's performance
is based upon the attainment of individual and business unit objectives. The
Company's performance is evaluated, compared to the ten largest electric
utilities and/or the electric utility industry, based upon its total return to
shareholders and return on invested capital, as well as other measures
relating to competitiveness, service quality and employee safety. The
combination of individual and Company performance results, together with the
Committee's evaluation of the competitive level of compensation which is
appropriate for such results, determines the amount, if any, actually awarded.

   The Long-Term Plan, which is also administered by the Committee, is a
comprehensive stock-based incentive compensation plan under which all awards
are made in, or based on the value of, the Company's common stock. The Long-
Term Plan provides that, in the discretion of the Committee, awards may be in
the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance and/or
restricted stock or stock units or in any other stock-based form. The purpose
of the Long-Term Plan is to provide performance-related incentives linked to
long-term performance goals. Such performance goals may be based on individual
performance and/or may include criteria such as absolute or relative levels of
total shareholder return, revenues, sales, net income or net worth of the
Company, any of its subsidiaries, business units or other areas, all as the
Committee may determine. Awards under the Long-Term Plan constitute the
principal long-term component of officers' compensation.

   In establishing levels of executive compensation at its May 2000 meeting,
the Committee reviewed various performance and compensation data, including
the performance measures under the AIP and the report of its compensation
consultant. Information was also gathered from industry sources and other
published and private materials which provided a basis for comparing the
largest electric and gas utilities and other survey groups representing a
large variety of business organizations. Included in the data considered were
the comparative returns provided by the largest electric and gas utilities as
represented by the returns of the Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index
which are reflected in the graph on page 19. Compensation amounts were
established by the Committee based upon its consideration of the above
comparative data and its subjective evaluation of Company and individual
performance at levels consistent with the Committee's policy relating to total
direct compensation.


                                      16
<PAGE>

   At its meeting in May 2000, the Committee provided awards of performance-
based restricted shares under the Long-Term Plan to certain officers,
including the Chief Executive. Information relating to awards made to the
named executive officers is contained in the Table on page 10 of this proxy
statement. The ultimate value of those awards will be determined by the
Company's total return to shareholders over a three year period compared to
the total return for that period of the companies comprising the Standard &
Poor's Electric Utility Index. Depending upon the Company's relative total
return for such period, the officers may earn from 0% to 200% of the original
award and their compensation is, thereby, directly related to shareholder
value. Awards granted in May 2000 contemplate that 200% of the original award
will be provided if the Company's total return is in the 81st percentile or
above of the returns of the companies comprising the Standard & Poor's
Electric Utility Index and that such percentage of the original award will be
reduced as the Company's return compared to the Index declines so that 0% of
the original award will be provided if the Company's return is in the 40th
percentile or below of returns provided by the companies comprising the Index.
These awards, and any awards that may be made in the future, are based upon
the Committee's evaluation of the appropriate level of long-term compensation
consistent with its policy relating to total direct compensation.

   Additionally with respect to the Long-Term Plan, the Committee, at its
meeting in May 2000, considered the restricted stock awards provided to
certain officers in May of 1997. Based upon its review and comparison of the
Company's total return to the returns provided by the companies comprising the
Standard & Poor's Electric Utility Index, the Committee determined that the
Company's performance during the three year performance period ending in March
of 2000 permitted the payment of 50% of such 1997 awards. Payments of these
awards were made in the form of the Company's stock and cash, and, for Messrs.
Nye, Gibbs and McNally, the value of the stock at the date of distribution is
included in the LTIP Payouts column of the Summary Compensation Table on page
8 of this proxy statement.

   During the year the Committee and the Board of Directors determined that it
was in the best interests of the Company to enter into employment agreements
with certain officers, including the Chief Executive. Accordingly, the
Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors subsequently approved, an
employment agreement with Mr. Nye which contemplates his continued service
through June 1, 2004 as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive. The
agreement provides, among other things, for a minimum annual base salary,
eligibility for an annual bonus under the terms of the AIP, minimum restricted
stock awards under the Long-Term Plan, certain severance benefits upon
termination of employment without cause and compensation and benefits under
certain circumstances following a change in control of the Company.
Additionally, the Committee ratified and approved employment contracts with
certain other officers of the Company and its subsidiaries including
agreements with Messrs. Dickie and McNally, named executive officers. The
agreements with Messrs. Nye, Dickie and McNally are described in footnote 6 on
pages 11 and 12 of this proxy statement.

   Mr. Nye's base salary as Chief Executive was not increased in 2000. Based
upon the Committee's evaluation of individual and Company performance, as
called for by the AIP, the Committee provided Mr. Nye with an AIP award of
$760,000 compared to the prior year's award of $950,000. The Committee also
awarded 75,000 shares of performance-based restricted stock to Mr. Nye. Under
the terms of the award, Mr. Nye can earn from 0% to 200% of the award
depending on the Company's total return to shareholders over a three-year
period (April 1, 2000 through March 31, 2003) compared

                                      17
<PAGE>

to the total return provided by the companies comprising the Standard & Poor's
Electric Utility Index. This level of compensation was established based upon
the Committee's subjective evaluation of the information described in this
report. In addition, as previously noted in this report, the Committee
approved the payment of 50% of the 1997 restricted stock awards under the
Long-Term Plan, which for Mr. Nye was 11,000 shares.

   In discharging its responsibilities with respect to establishing executive
compensation, the Committee normally considers such matters at its May meeting
held in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Although Company
management may be present during Committee discussions of officers'
compensation, Committee decisions with respect to the compensation of the
Chief Executive are reached in private session without the presence of any
member of Company management.

   Section 162(m) of the Code limits the deductibility of compensation which a
publicly traded corporation provides to its most highly compensated officers.
As a general policy, the Company does not intend to provide compensation which
is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Awards under the AIP in
1996 and subsequent years have been, and are expected to continue to be, fully
deductible. Awards under the Long-Term Plan are expected to be fully
deductible, and the DICP and the Salary Deferral Program have been amended to
require the deferral of distributions of amounts maturing in years subsequent
to 1995 until the time when such amounts would be deductible.

   Shareholder comments to the Committee are welcomed and should be addressed
to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's offices.

                            AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Committee) assists the Board
in providing oversight of the Company's auditing, accounting and financial
reporting processes, and the Company's system of internal control. The role
and responsibilities of the Committee are fully set forth in the Committee's
written charter which was approved by the Board of Directors and which is
reproduced in Appendix A to this proxy statement. The Committee consists
solely of independent directors as defined by the listing standards of the New
York Stock Exchange and is chaired by William M. Griffin. The Committee has
directed the preparation of this report and has approved its content and
submission to the shareholders.

   The Committee has received the written disclosures and letter from Deloitte
& Touche LLP, the independent auditors for the Company, as required by
Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with
Audit Committee), and has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP its
independence. In this regard the Committee considered whether or not the
provision of non-audit services by Deloitte & Touche LLP for the year 2000 is
compatible with maintaining the independence of the firm.

   The Committee reviewed and discussed with Company management and Deloitte &
Touche LLP the interim unaudited financial statements and the audited
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December
31, 2000. The Committee also discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP those
matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61
(Communication with Audit Committees) concerning the quality of the Company's
accounting principles as applied in its financial statements.

   Based on its review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board
of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Additionally, as noted hereinafter in this proxy statement, the Committee
recommended to the Board of Directors that Deloitte & Touche LLP be selected
to act as independent auditors for 2001, subject to shareholder approval.

   Shareholder comments to the Committee are welcomed and should be addressed
to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's offices.

                             SELECTION OF AUDITORS

   The Audit Committee has nominated to the Board of Directors for its
consideration the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP to act as independent auditors
for the Company for the year 2001 and, subject to the approval of shareholders
at the annual meeting, the Board has selected that firm to audit the books of
account and records of the Company and to make a report thereon to the
shareholders. The persons named in the proxy will, unless otherwise instructed
thereon, vote your shares in favor of the following resolution which will be
submitted for consideration:

     RESOLVED that the selection of the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP,
  independent auditors, to audit the books of account and records of the
  Company for the year 2001, to make a report thereon, and to perform
  other services, be, and it hereby is, approved.

   The firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, has been the
outside auditors for the Company since its organization in 1996 and for TXU
Energy Industries Company (formerly Texas Utilities Company) since its
organization in 1945, including the last fiscal year. During the year ended
December 31, 2000 fees billed to the Company by Deloitte & Touche LLP were as
follows:

     Audit Fees. Fees billed for professional services rendered in
  connection with the audit of the Company's annual consolidated
  financial statements and reviews of the consolidated financial
  statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q were $3,170,000.

     Financial Information System Design and Implementation Fees. No
  fees were billed by Deloitte & Touche LLP for financial information
  system design and implementation services during 2000.

     All Other Fees.  Deloitte & Touche LLP's fees for all other
  professional services rendered to the Company during 2000 totaled
  $9,676,000 including audit related fees of $6,908,000 and other fees
  of $2,768,000. Audit related fees included amounts billed in
  connection with financings, rate case proceedings, business
  development activities, certain statutorily required audits and
  employee benefit plan audits. Fees for other services were associated
  with management advisory and tax services.

   Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the
annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they
desire to do so, and to respond to appropriate questions.

   In August 1999, based upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee, the
Board of Directors of TXU Europe Limited appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as
the principal accountants for TXU Europe Limited and its subsidiaries. TXU
Europe Limited chose not to continue the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
its former principal accountants. The decision by TXU Europe Limited to change
principal accountants was made in order to align the principal accountants of
TXU Europe Limited with those of the Company.

   No report of PricewaterhouseCoopers on TXU Europe Limited's financial
statements contained any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was any
report qualified in any manner. There were no disagreements with
PricewaterhouseCoopers on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. In addition,
there were no "reportable events" as that term is defined in the SEC rules.

   The Board of Directors Recommends a Vote FOR the Approval of Auditors.

                                OTHER BUSINESS

   Other than as stated herein, the Board of Directors does not intend to
bring any business before the meeting and it has not been informed of any
matters that may be presented to the meeting by others. However, if any other
matters properly come before the meeting, it is the intent of the Board of
Directors that the persons named in the proxy will vote pursuant to the proxy
in accordance with their judgment in such matters.

                                  APPENDIX A

                            AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER

   Role. The principal role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of
Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities applicable to the
company's auditing, accounting and financial reporting processes and the
company's system of internal control. Consistent with this role, the Committee
is to encourage continuous improvement of, and foster adherence to, the
company's policies, procedures and practices at all levels. The Committee's
primary duties and responsibilities are to:

  .  Serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the company's
     financial reporting process and internal control system;

  .  Review and appraise the audit activities of the company's independent
     auditor and internal audit staff; and

  .  Foster open communication among the independent auditor, financial and
     senior management, internal audit and the Board of Directors.

   Composition. The Committee shall be comprised of three or more directors as
determined by the Board, each of whom shall be independent directors, and free
from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with
the exercise of his or her independent judgment as a member of the Committee.
To be a member of the Committee, a director must satisfy the independence
requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, all Committee
members must be financially literate and at least one member shall have
accounting or related financial management expertise, both as may be
determined from time to time by the Board of Directors in the exercise of its
business judgment.

   As soon as practical after the annual meeting of shareholders each year,
the Board shall appoint the Committee to serve for the ensuing twelve months
or until their successors shall be duly appointed and qualified. The Committee
may elect a chairman and may make rules for the conduct of its business and
appoint such committees and assistants as it may deem necessary. A majority of
the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum.

   Meetings. The Committee shall meet at least four times annually, or more
frequently as the Committee may determine. As part of its role to foster open
communication, the Committee should meet semiannually with internal audit and
the independent auditor in separate executive sessions to discuss any matters
that the Committee or any of these groups believe should be discussed
privately.

   Responsibilities. In fulfilling its responsibilities and duties the
Committee shall generally perform the following functions, subject to such
modifications as the Committee may, from time to time, determine to be
necessary or appropriate:

  .  Recommend to the Board of Directors the selection and retention of the
     independent auditor who audits the financial statements of the company.
     In so doing, the Committee will: consider matters which might affect the
     auditor's independence, including the provision of non-audit services;
     discuss and consider the auditor's written affirmation that the auditor
     is in fact independent; discuss the nature and rigor of the audit
     process; receive and review all reports from the auditor; and provide to
     the independent auditor full access to the Committee (and the Board) to
     report on any and all matters deemed to be appropriate. It is recognized
     that the independent auditor is ultimately accountable to the Committee
     and the Board of Directors of the company.


                                      A-1
<PAGE>

  .  Provide guidance and oversight to the internal audit function of the
     company including review of the organization, plans and results of such
     activities.

  .  Review the financial statements and related information in the annual
     report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K with
     management and the independent auditor and make a recommendation to the
     Board as to whether or not the audited financial statements should be
     included in the Form 10-K. It is anticipated that these reviews will
     include discussions of the quality of earnings, discussions of
     significant items subject to management's judgment or estimate,
     consideration of the suitability of accounting principles, consideration
     of audit adjustments whether or not recorded and such other inquiries
     and discussions as may be appropriate.

  .  Review the interim financial statements and related information in the
     quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-Q
     with financial management and the independent auditor prior to its
     filing.

  .  Discuss with management and the auditors the quality and adequacy of the
     company's internal controls.

  .  Report on Committee activities to the full Board and prepare annually a
     summary report suitable for submission to the shareholders in the proxy
     statement.

  .  Establish, review and update periodically a Code of Conduct and review
     the systems and practices that management has established to enforce the
     Code.

  .  Perform any other activities consistent with this charter, the company's
     by-laws and governing law, as the Committee or the Board deems necessary
     or appropriate.

   Revision and Publication of Charter. In addition to its other
responsibilities, the Committee shall review the adequacy and appropriateness
of this charter at least annually and make recommendations to the Board with
respect thereto. The charter will be included in the proxy statement at least
every three years.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

BUSINESS

   In May 2000, Texas Utilities Company changed its corporate name to TXU
Corp. TXU Corp. is a Texas corporation which was formed in 1997 as a holding
company. TXU Corp. is the successor to TXU Energy Industries Company, the
holding company for the TXU system prior to the August 5, 1997 acquisition of
TXU Gas Company. TXU Energy Industries Company was organized in 1945 as Texas
Utilities Company.

   TXU Corp. engages in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution
and sale of electricity; the purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of
natural gas; and energy marketing, energy services, telecommunications and
other businesses. TXU Corp. is a multinational energy services company and one
of the largest energy services companies in the world with more than $22
billion in revenue and $45 billion of assets. TXU Corp. has 30,000 megawatts
of power generation and sells 270 terawatt hours of electricity and 2 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas annually. TXU Corp. delivers or sells energy to
approximately 11 million customers primarily in the United States (US), Europe
and Australia.

   TXU Corp.'s five reportable operating segments are either strategic
business units that offer different products and services or are
geographically integrated. They are managed separately because each business
requires different marketing strategies or is in a different geographic area.

   (1) US Electric -- operations involving the generation, purchase,
transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in the north central,
eastern and western portions of Texas (primarily TXU Electric Company (TXU
Electric), TXU SESCO Company (TXU SESCO), TXU Fuel Company (TXU Fuel) and TXU
Mining Company (TXU Mining) operations);

   (2) US Gas -- operations involving the purchase, transmission, distribution
and sale of natural gas in Texas (primarily TXU Lone Star Pipeline and TXU Gas
Distribution, divisions of TXU Gas Company);

   (3) US Energy -- operations involving purchasing and selling natural gas
and electricity and providing risk management and retail energy services for
the energy industry throughout the US and parts of Canada (primarily TXU
Energy Trading Company (TXU Energy Trading) and TXU Energy Services Company
(TXU Energy Services) operations);

   (4) Europe -- operations involving the generation, purchase, distribution,
marketing and sale of electricity; the purchase and sale of natural gas; and
energy merchant trading; within the UK but increasingly throughout the rest of
Europe (primarily TXU Europe Group plc.)

   (5) Australia -- operations involving the generation, purchase,
distribution, trading and retailing of electricity and the retailing, storage
and distribution of natural gas, primarily in the States of Victoria and South
Australia (primarily TXU Australia Holdings (Partnership) Limited Partnership
(TXU Australia) operations); and

   Other -- non-segment operations consisting of telecommunications and other
activities.

   Certain comparisons in this report have been affected by TXU Europe's
acquisition of Norweb Energi in August 2000, TXU Australia's acquisition of
Optima Energy Pty Ltd. (Optima) in May 2000, the February 1999 acquisition of
the gas retail business of TXU Pty. Ltd. and the gas distribution business of
TXU Networks (Gas) Pty. Ltd. (together, TXU Australia Gas) in Australia and
the May 1998 acquisition of The Energy Group PLC (TEG), the former holding
company of TXU Europe. These

                                      B-4
<PAGE>

acquisitions were accounted for as purchase business combinations. The results
of operations of each acquired company are included in the consolidated
financial statements of TXU Corp. only for the periods subsequent to their
respective dates of acquisition. (See Note 15 to financial statements for
information concerning reportable segments.)

   The following exchange rates have been used to convert foreign currency
denominated amounts into US dollars, unless they were determined using

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

2000 versus 1999

   Earnings for 2000 reflect strong contributions from the US Electric, US Gas
and Europe segments, partially offset by results of the US Energy segment and
the reduction in the relative value of the pound sterling. Results for 2000
include a full year of operations of TXU Australia Gas and operations of
Optima and Norweb Energi from their acquisition dates in May and August 2000,
respectively, while the 1999 results included operations of TXU Australia Gas
from its February 1999 acquisition date. Results for 2000 also benefited from
the sale of TXU Processing assets, the metering business in Europe and other
sales of non-strategic investments and assets during the year, and from the
favorable resolution of certain regulatory matters. Offsetting these benefits
were restructuring charges recorded in Europe, primarily associated with the
establishment of the 24seven joint venture and bid-related costs associated
with the intended offer for Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico, SA
(Hidrocantabrico). Year to year comparisons of earnings per share benefited
from the repurchase of approximately 18.6 million and 6.1 million shares of
TXU Corp. common stock in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

   Net income available for common stock for 2000 was $904 million ($3.43 per
share) compared with $985 million ($3.53 per share) for 1999. Results for 2000
include after-tax gains of $34 million on the sale of substantially all of the
assets of TXU Processing, $31 million on the sale of the metering business in
Europe, $21 million on the sale of TXU Europe's investment in the Czech
utility, Severomoravska energetika, a.s. (SME), $18 million on the sale of
land of TXU Electric and $49 million on the sale of other non-strategic
investments and assets. Offsetting these gains were $85 million after-tax
restructuring charges recorded in Europe, primarily associated with the
establishment of the 24seven joint venture and $11 million of bid-related
costs associated with the intended offer for Hidrocantabrico. Results for 1999
included a $145 million after-tax gain from the sale of the 20% interest in
PrimeCo Personal Communications LP (PrimeCo), a $31 million after-tax charge
for a fuel reconciliation settlement, and charges totaling $17 million after-
tax in Australia primarily for integration and acquisition-related costs.

   US Electric results for the year reflect continued strong revenue and
customer growth, asset sales and significant mitigation of stranded costs. The
US Gas segment results showed strong improvement, primarily as a result of
increased margin due to rate relief granted, significantly increased volumes
distributed in response to colder winter weather, growth and cost reductions.
The results for the US Energy segment were less than 1999 primarily due to
lower margins on energy trading activities, costs associated with moving the
trading operations to Dallas, continued planned expenditures to prepare

                                      B-5
<PAGE>

the trading and retail operations for the opening of the Texas electricity
market to competition in 2002 and higher bad debt expense. Australian segment
results improved with the integration of natural gas operations, the addition
of the Western Underground Gas Storage (WUGS) facility, development of the
merchant trading operations and the purchase of certain assets and liabilities
of Optima, including a 100-year lease of a 1,280 megawatt natural gas-powered
generating station in South Australia. TXU Europe operations provided strong
results for 2000, offsetting the impact of regulatory rate reductions in its
networks business through continued growth in its merchant energy business.
The strength of the dollar in 2000 compared with 1999 also negatively affected
reported results from Europe and Australia.

   See Notes 3 and 13 to Financial Statements for a discussion of the 1999
Texas electric industry restructuring legislation (1999 Restructuring
Legislation). Following the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, earnings in excess
of the regulatory earnings cap have been recorded as a reduction of revenues,
with a corresponding regulatory liability recorded. Application of the
earnings cap reduced net income by $202 million in 2000 and $90 million in
1999. US Electric segment's earnings in excess of the earnings cap were
reduced by $44 million ($28 million after-tax) in 2000, reflecting the
favorable resolution of regulatory matters relating to the 1999 calculation.

   In addition, as a result of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation,
transmission and distribution (T&D) depreciation expense was no longer
transferred to nuclear production assets; instead an amount equivalent to T&D
depreciation was recorded as a regulatory asset, with an offsetting amount
recorded as a regulatory liability. The regulatory asset will be amortized as
it is recovered through the Distribution portion of the business, while the
regulatory liabilities will be applied as mitigation (reduction) of stranded
generation assets. (See Note 13 to Financial Statements.) Additional
mitigation in 2000 was $509 million, including $305 million to reduce earnings
to the earnings cap and $204 million from the establishment of a regulatory
asset in the amount of T&D depreciation. Since January 1998, TXU Electric has
recorded more than $2 billion of nuclear depreciation and mitigation, which
reduces stranded costs.

   Operating revenues for 2000 were 29% higher than 1999. This was primarily
due to the inclusion of Optima and Norweb Energi for the period following
acquisition, the expansion of merchant energy trading in Europe, increased
customer growth, warmer summer and colder winter weather in the US, higher
fuel revenues for the US Electric and US Gas segments and increased power
trading activities coupled with higher volumes traded and natural gas prices
for the US Energy segment.

   Total operating expenses for 2000 were 34% higher than 1999. This was
primarily due to the inclusion of Optima and Norweb Energi for the period
following acquisition, increases in energy purchased and fuel consumed as a
result of the rise in natural gas prices and increased energy consumption due
to the hotter than normal summer weather and colder winter weather. The
decrease in operating and maintenance expense in 2000 compared to 1999 is due
to the decrease in gas processing expenses as a result of the sale of gas
processing assets, savings generated from the integration of electric and gas
operations in Australia and reductions in costs due to the development of
24seven and corporate cost reduction programs in Europe begun in prior years.
Operating expenses also reflect lower depreciation and other amortization
expense in 2000 compared to 1999 due to mitigation depreciation transfers at
TXU Electric in 1999 partially offset by higher goodwill amortization in 2000.

   The overall effective income tax rate for 2000 was 27% compared to 31% for
1999. The year 2000 benefited from lower state effective income tax rates,
foreign tax credits, the favorable resolution of certain foreign tax matters
relating to prior tax issues and other tax benefits associated with non-US
operations. Partially offsetting these favorable items was greater non-

1999 versus 1998

   Earnings for 1999 reflect continued strong results from US Electric
operations and a significant improvement from US Gas operations in spite of
very mild winter weather. Results for 1999 reflect a full year of operations
of TXU Europe and operations of TXU Australia Gas from its February 1999
acquisition date, while the 1998 results included operations of TXU Europe
from its May 1998 acquisition date. Results for 1999 also benefited from the
sale of PrimeCo. Contributions from Australian operations were lower in 1999
primarily due to very mild winter weather. The results of US Energy operations
were less than 1998 primarily due to lower gas trading margins and in part to
expenditures necessary to prepare for the opening of the Texas electricity
market to competition in 2002. Year-to-year comparisons of earnings per share
were affected by the issuance in 1998 of 37.3 million shares of common stock
for the acquisition of TEG and the repurchase of 6.1 million and .6 million of
TXU Corp. common shares in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

   Net income for 1999 was $985 million ($3.53 per share) compared with $740
million ($2.79 per share) for 1998, a 33% improvement. Results for 1999
include a $222 million pre-tax ($145 million after tax) gain from the sale of
the 20% interest in PrimeCo, which is recorded in other income, a $52 million
pre-tax ($31 million after tax) fuel reconciliation settlement, and charges
totaling $17 million after-tax in Australia primarily for integration and
acquisition-related costs. Results for 1998 included a gain from TXU Europe's
renegotiation of a long-term gas contract and costs associated with the
acquisition of TEG, which offset to add $7 million to 1998 net income.

   From January 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, earnings in excess of the
earnings cap were recorded as additional depreciation of nuclear production
assets. Effective July 1, 1999, following the 1999 Restructuring Legislation,
earnings in excess of the earnings cap were recorded as a reduction of
revenues, with a corresponding regulatory liability recorded. Application of
the earnings cap reduced net income by $90 million in 1999 and $143 million in
1998.

   Additionally from January 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, depreciation
expense was reclassified from T&D to nuclear production assets. Effective July
1, 1999, following the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, T&D depreciation
expense was no longer transferred to nuclear production assets; instead an
amount equivalent to T&D depreciation was recorded as a regulatory asset, with
a corresponding amount recorded as a regulatory liability. Additional nuclear
mitigation in 1999 was $336 million, including $144 million to reduce earnings
to the earnings cap, $95 million of depreciation expense reclassified from T&D
to nuclear production assets and an amount equivalent to $97 million of T&D
depreciation expense recorded as a regulatory asset.

   In June 1999, TXU Electric refunded $52 million to consumers as part of a
fuel reconciliation proceeding with the Public Utility Commission of Texas
(PUC). The refund, which was recorded as a reduction of revenues, was
approximately 1% of the $5.04 billion spent by TXU Electric during the period
from July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1998 for fuel to generate electricity and
appeared as a one-time credit on customer bills during the September 1999
billing cycle.

   Excluding the $92 million reduction of revenues in 1999 as a result of
earnings in excess of the earnings cap and the $52 million fuel reconciliation
disallowance, operating revenues for 1999 were 17% higher than 1998. The
increase was primarily due to the inclusion of TXU Europe for a full period in
1999 and TXU Australia Gas since acquisition in February 1999.

   Total operating expenses for 1999 were 18% higher than 1998. Substantially
all of the increase was due to the inclusion of TXU Europe for a full period
in 1999 and TXU Australia Gas since acquisition, partially offset by less
mitigation depreciation recorded by TXU Electric in 1999 versus 1998.

                                      B-7
<PAGE>

   Total interest expense and other charges were 13% higher in 1999 than in
1998. The increase was principally due to debt incurred and assumed in
connection with the acquisitions of the European operations and TXU Australia
Gas, partially offset by the favorable impact of capital restructuring and
debt reduction programs.

   The overall effective income tax rate for 1999 was 31% versus 41% for 1998.
The year 1999 benefited from the discontinuation of amortization of prior-
period flow-through amounts and other tax-related regulatory assets and
liabilities of TXU Electric as a result of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation,
foreign tax credits and other tax benefits associated with non-US operations,
and the reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a result of a
1999 change in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations. Partially
offsetting these favorable items was greater non-deductible goodwill
amortization in 1999.

2000 versus 1999

   Net income for the US Electric segment of $883 million in 2000 was 14%
higher than 1999. Comparisons of net income were affected by gains in 2000
from asset sales of $18 million after tax, the favorable resolution of
previously discussed regulatory matters, higher rate base and lower interest
expense. A fuel reconciliation settlement reduced 1999 net income by $31
million.

   Excluding the reduction of revenues as a result of the earnings cap and the
fuel reconciliation settlement, operating revenues for 2000 were 21% higher
than 1999. Revenues in 2000 were $1.4 billion more than in 1999 due to the
increase in fuel revenue, growth and customer demand, including hotter than
normal summer weather and an extremely cold fourth quarter 2000. Cooling
degree days in 2000 were 119% of normal compared to 114% of normal in 1999.
Heating degree days in 2000 were 95% of normal compared to 70% of normal in
1999. Electric energy sales volumes for 2000 were 6% higher than in 1999. Fuel
revenues for 2000 were $1.0 billion higher than in 1999, primarily as a result
of higher energy sales and increased fuel prices.

   Operation and maintenance expenses for 2000 were 7% higher than 1999
primarily as a result of a $52 million writeoff of certain restructuring
expenses and other regulatory assets and increased regulated third-party
transmission rates. Excluding these items, operation and maintenance expenses
were up less than 1%. Depreciation and other amortization expense was $31
million lower in 2000 compared to 1999, which included mitigation depreciation
of $52 million.

   Interest expense and other charges of $475 million for 2000 were 8% lower
than 1999 due to the reacquisition of long-term debt and remarketing of
certain debt to lower interest rates.

   The effective income tax rate for 2000 and 1999 was 31%.

1999 versus 1998

   Net income for the US Electric segment of $773 million for 1999 was 1.9%
lower than 1998. Comparisons of net income were impacted by both a fuel
reconciliation settlement that reduced 1999 net income by $31 million and a
rate settlement agreement that became effective in January 1998 and was
modified by the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, which reduced customer rates
and introduced an earnings cap.

   Excluding the reduction of revenues as a result of the earnings cap and the
fuel reconciliation settlement, operating revenues for 1999 were 2% lower than
1998. Revenues in 1999 were $160 million less than 1998 due to the impact of
the exceptionally hot summer weather in 1998. An additional reduction in rates
effective January 1, 1999 due to the 1998 rate settlement agreement was
somewhat offset by continued strong core retail sales and revenue growth.
Electric energy sales volumes for 1999 were 3% lower than 1998. Fuel revenues
for 1999 were slightly lower than in 1998, primarily as a result of lower
energy sales.

   Operation and maintenance expenses for 1999 were 4% higher than 1998
largely as a result of increased third party transmission tariffs.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $109 million lower in 1999 versus
1998 primarily due to less mitigation depreciation recorded in 1999. Earnings
in excess of the earnings cap recorded as additional nuclear depreciation in
1999 was $52 million versus $170 million in 1998.

   The net decrease of $62 million in interest expense and other charges for
1999 compared to 1998 was primarily due to the reacquisition of long-term debt
and remarketing of certain debt to lower interest rates.

   The effective income tax rate was lower in 1999 compared to 1998 due
primarily to the discontinuation of amortization of prior-period flow-through
amounts and other tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities resulting from
the impact of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation.

2000 versus 1999

   The US Gas segment had net income of $49 million for 2000 compared with $4
million for 1999. Operating results for 2000 reflect increased margin for gas
distribution operations due to rate relief granted, significantly increased
volumes distributed in response to colder winter weather, growth and cost
reductions. Net income for 2000 includes the $34 million after-tax gain on the
sale of gas processing assets while net income for 1999 included after-tax
gains of $8 million from the sale of assets.

   Significant increases in operating revenues and gas purchased for resale
resulted from the rise in prices for natural gas experienced in 2000, the
increased demand for natural gas due to colder winter weather and growth.
These effects are greatest in gas distribution operations. Operating revenues
for gas distribution operations for 2000 increased by $330 million over 1999,
and gas purchased for resale for 2000 increased by $280 million over 1999.
Operation and maintenance expense decreased in 2000 by $46 million primarily
as a result of the sale of gas processing assets. Taxes other than income
increased by $4 million in 2000 primarily due to increased revenues subject to
state and local gross receipts taxes. Interest income for the segment
increased by $10 million in 2000 compared with 1999, while interest and other
charges increased by $5 million in 2000 compared with 1999. The overall
increase of $5 million in net interest income in 2000 resulted from the use of
proceeds from the sale of gas processing assets. The effective tax rate in
1999 was affected by a reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance while
both years were affected by the amortization of non-deductible goodwill.

1999 versus 1998

   The US Gas segment had net income of $4 million for 1999 compared with a
net loss of $33 million for 1998. Strong cost controls and improved margins
contributed to the results for 1999, as did after-tax gains totaling $8
million from the sale of assets and a reversal of a deferred tax asset
valuation allowance as a result of a 1999 change in Internal Revenue Service
regulations.

   Operating revenues for 1999 increased by $13 million over 1998 primarily
from higher gas processing revenues, partially offset by lower distribution
and pipeline revenues resulting from the very mild winter weather. Gas
purchased for resale declined by $17 million in 1999 because of lower demand.
Higher gas processing fees in 1999, primarily caused by higher natural gas
liquids prices, were more than offset by cost reductions in other operation
and maintenance expenses. Depreciation and other amortization expenses
increased by $8 million primarily due to increased distribution system
depreciation. Taxes other than income decreased by $7 million from 1998 to
1999 primarily due to decreased local franchise taxes resulting from decreased
revenues subject to the taxes.

2000 versus 1999

   The US Energy segment had a net loss of $88 million for 2000 compared with
a net loss of $43 million for 1999. Results for 2000 reflect lower margins on
energy trading activities, costs associated with moving the trading operations
to Dallas, continued planned expenditures to prepare the trading and retail
operations for the opening of the Texas electricity market to competition in
2002 and higher bad debt expense.

   Operating revenues for the US Energy segment increased from $3.1 billion in
1999 to $5.5 billion in 2000, with the increase primarily attributable to
significantly higher natural gas prices and an increase in power trading.
Operating loss increased from $60 million in 1999 to $118 million in 2000 due
to decreased trading margins and an increase in operation and maintenance
expense from $147 million in 1999 to $187 million in 2000, principally due to
relocation costs, costs to prepare for competition in Texas in 2002 and higher
bad debt expense. Results for 1999 included other income from the sale of
commercial customer accounts. Interest income increased from $2 million in
1999 to $7 million in 2000 due to interest earned on margin deposits. Interest
and other charges increased from $12 million in 1999 to $24 million in 2000 as
a result of increased costs to finance expansion of the business and margin
requirements.

1999 versus 1998

   Results for 1999 for the US Energy segment were down from 1998 due to lower
gas trading margins, planned costs to develop infrastructure capabilities and
high natural gas prices which affected the results from retail marketing
originations. The segment had a net loss of $43 million for 1999 compared with
a net loss of $11 million for 1998.

   Operating revenues decreased from $3.2 billion in 1998 to $3.1 billion in
1999 primarily due to a decision to reduce electricity trading. Operating loss
increased from $9 million in 1998 to $60 million in 1999 as operation and
maintenance expense increased from $76 million in 1998 to $147 million in 1999
due to increased costs of services for retail operations primarily as a result
of growth, higher development expenses and expenditures to prepare the trading
and retail operations for the opening of the Texas electricity market to
competition in 2002. Results for 1999 included other income of $4 million from
the sale of commercial customer accounts, while 1998 included other deductions
of $3 million.

*For the period from acquisition (May 19, 1998) to December 31, 1998.


2000 versus 1999

   TXU Europe contributed net income of $215 million for 2000 compared with
$280 million for 1999. Results for 2000 were adversely affected by
Distribution Price Controls, which reduced rates by 28% effective April 1,
2000, and strengthening of the US dollar against the pound sterling, which
decreased net income approximately $16 million. TXU Europe's results for 2000
included costs of $120 million ($85 million after-tax), mostly for
restructuring charges associated with the creation of the joint venture
24seven to operate TXU Europe's distribution system, the contracting of TXU
Europe's customer service function to Vertex Data Science Limited (Vertex) and
for other staff reorganizations, and $11 million for costs associated with the
offer for Hidrocantabrico. Partially offsetting these costs was an after-tax
gain of $31 million from the sale of the metering business. Results for 2000
also benefited from other portfolio adjustments including the $21 million
after-tax gain on the sale of TXU Europe's interest in SME.

   TXU Europe's revenues for 2000 were (Pounds)4.7 billion ($7.0 billion)
compared with (Pounds)3.8 billion ($6.1 billion) for 1999, a 16% increase. On
a pound sterling basis, the increase in revenues was 24%. Revenues from the
energy retail segment for 2000 were (Pounds)2.2 billion ($3.2 billion)
compared with (Pounds)2.2 billion ($3.6 billion) for 1999, reflecting the
addition of customers from the Norweb Energi business offset by a reduction in
revenues from other customers. The primary increase in total revenues is
attributable to the portfolio trading and power segment (formerly the energy
management and generation segment) which were (Pounds)2.3 billion ($3.5
billion) in 2000 compared with (Pounds)1.4 billion ($2.3 billion) in 1999.
This increase is primarily the result of the expansion of merchant energy
trading activity. Wholesale electricity and gas sales volumes in 2000
increased 27% and 124%, respectively,

                                     B-12
<PAGE>

over 1999. The Central European operations achieved significant growth in
trading in 2000, with 97 terawatt hours (TWh) of power trades and 60 TWh
equivalent of gas trades in 2000 compared with 4 TWh of power and trades 1 TWh
equivalent of gas trades in 1999. Networks revenues were (Pounds)371 million
($559 million) for 2000 compared with (Pounds)429 million ($696 million) for
1999. The decrease primarily reflects the adverse impact of the Office of Gas
and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) Distribution Price Controls, which reduced
rates by 28% effective April 1, 2000, partially offset by higher unit sales in
2000 compared with 1999. In response to the rate reduction, the distribution
joint venture, 24seven, was created to provide distribution services to
customers at lower cost.

   Excluding the (Pounds)72 million ($109 million) of restructuring costs
included in 2000, operating and maintenance expenses were (Pounds)622 million
($941 million) compared with (Pounds)706 million ($1.1 billion) for the same
period of 1999. The reduction from the comparable 1999 amounts reflects the
underlying benefits of staff reorganizations and other exit costs and on-going
cost savings programs throughout TXU Europe, partially offset by the inclusion
of Norweb Energi.

   Depreciation expense was (Pounds)159 million ($241 million) for 2000
compared with (Pounds)173 million ($281 million) for 1999. The decrease is due
primarily to a change in depreciation method and depreciable lives on network
distribution assets. In the third quarter of 2000, TXU Europe implemented a
change in the depreciation method for its distribution system assets from an
accelerated method to a straight line method as of December 31, 1999. The
straight line method has been implemented to better recognize the cost of the
assets over the anticipated useful life of the assets. The cumulative effect
of this change in accounting principle of (Pounds)10 million ($14 million)
((Pounds)7 million, $10 million after-tax) was not material to TXU Corp. and
is reported in other income (deductions)--net. Also in the third quarter of
2000, TXU Europe revised the estimated useful economic lives of its
distribution system assets. Such assets are now depreciated over a composite
period of 50 years. The effect of the change in estimate is not significant on
an annual basis. As a result of the acquisition of Norweb Energi in August
2000, amortization of goodwill is expected to be slightly higher in future
periods.

   Interest expense and other charges for 2000 was (Pounds)378 million ($574
million) compared with (Pounds)347 million ($563 million) for 1999. The
increase was due to higher variable interest rates and a higher level of debt.
interest income was (Pounds)59 million ($90 million) for 2000 compared with
(Pounds)63 million ($102 million) for 1999.

   Total income tax expense for the Europe segment for 2000 was $94 million
compared with $153 million for 1999. The effective tax rate in both periods is
affected by amortization of goodwill and other non-deductible items, primarily
related to a capital lease. The effective tax rate in 2000 also reflects a
(Pounds)18 million ($27 million) favorable resolution of certain prior year
tax matters.

   New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) -- Following a comprehensive
reassessment of the timetable for completion of all the necessary testing, the
implementation of NETA is now scheduled to commence on March 27, 2001,
although the date may be revised before then based on the progress in the
ability of participants to communicate with the central systems being
installed and other concerns. Under NETA, for those companies wishing to buy
and sell electricity, the arrangements provide the freedom to enter into
directly negotiated contracts instead of having to trade through a central
electricity pool. It is expected that under the new arrangements bulk
electricity will be traded on one or more exchanges and through a variety of
bilateral and multilateral contracts and that market participants will include
not only generators and suppliers but also traders with physical positions,
i.e. energy wholesalers; accordingly, NETA implementation will eliminate the
Pool. The new arrangements provide mechanisms for near real-time clearing and
settlement of differences between contractual and physical positions of those
buying, selling, producing and consuming electricity. A balancing mechanism
will enable the system operator (National Grid Company) to change levels of
generation and demand near to real-time; and a mechanism for imbalance
settlement will provide for the settling of the differences between net
physical and net contractual position of parties.

                                     B-13
<PAGE>

   Electricity supply businesses have incurred significant costs to introduce
and operate under NETA, while the financial impact on distributors has been
minimal. Although the UK government proposes that such costs will ultimately
be borne by customers, OFGEM has not allowed recovery of such costs in the
price controls which became effective on April 1, 2000. TXU Europe's ability
to manage its energy purchase price risk depends, in part, on the continuing
availability of properly priced risk management mechanisms such as contracts
for differences and electricity forward agreements. No assurance can be given
that an adequate, transparent market for such products will in fact be
available in the future (including NETA).

   TXU Europe is unable to determine, at this time, what impact the
implementation of NETA will have on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

1999 versus 1998

   The 1999 results for the Europe segment represent a full year of
operations, while the 1998 period is from date of acquisition (May 19, 1998)
to December 31, 1998. The 1998 period also includes the 22% equity in the net
income of TEG for the period March to May 19, 1998. The Europe segment
contributed net income for 1999 of $280 million compared with $140 million in
the 1998 period.

   The Europe segment added (Pounds)3.8 billion ($6.1 billion) to 1999
operating revenues versus (Pounds)2.2 billion ($3.6 million) in the 1998
period. Revenues from energy retail operations for 1999 were (Pounds)2.2
billion ($3.6 billion) compared with (Pounds)1.3 billion ($2.2 billion) in
1998. Volumes in the gas residential market increased in 1999 as a result of
the market being fully opened to competition. Electricity volumes decreased
due to the loss of industrial and commercial customers in the October 1999
contract round; however, prices improved. Revenues from portfolio trading and
power operations for 1999 were (Pounds)1.4 billion ($2.3 billion) versus
(Pounds)746 million ($1.2 billion) in the 1998 period. Greater operating
volumes in the gas portfolio increased revenues, partially offset by lower
revenues in the electricity portfolio due to lower time-weighted Pool purchase
prices (weighted for time of day sales) and reduced volumes. Revenues from the
networks business for 1999 were (Pounds)429 million ($696 million) compared
with (Pounds)253 million ($421 million) in the 1998 period. GWh's distributed
increased by approximately 3% year on year, and regulated prices increased
approximately 1% from April 1999. Other revenues included (Pounds)18 million
($29 million) in 1999, related to the metering business. In the 1998 period,
other revenues included an aggregate of (Pounds)31 million ($52 million) for
metering revenues, revenues from the telecommunications business sold in
December 1998 and revenues from the modular building business sold in February
1999.

   Energy purchased for resale and fuel consumed for 1999 was (Pounds)2.2
billion ($3.6 billion) compared with (Pounds)1.3 billion ($2.2 billion) in the
1998 period. Operation and maintenance expenses for the full year of 1999 were
(Pounds)706 million ($1.1 billion) versus (Pounds)379 million ($628 million)
in the 1998 period. Depreciation and amortization, including goodwill
amortization, totaled (Pounds)260 million ($421 million) in 1999 compared with
(Pounds)144 million ($240 million) in 1998.

   Interest expense for 1999 was (Pounds)347 million ($563 million) compared
with (Pounds)269 million ($447 million) in the 1998 period from the date of
acquisition. The segment had interest income of (Pounds)63 million
($102 million) in 1999 versus (Pounds)64 million ($106 million) in the 1998
period.

   The effective tax rate for the Europe segment was 35% in 1999 versus 46% in
the 1998 period. The rate in 1999 benefited from foreign tax credits, while
the 1998 period benefited from a 1% reduction in the UK statutory tax rate and
included income that was taxed at rates less than the statutory rate. Non-
deductible expenses related to capital leases and goodwill amortization also
affected both periods.

*Includes results of Optima and TXU Australia Gas from date of acquisition of
 May 4, 2000 and February 24, 1999, respectively.


2000 versus 1999

   TXU Australia had net income of $57 million for 2000 compared with $6
million for 1999. Results for 2000 include a full year of merchant trading
operations and operations of TXU Australia Gas, and results of Optima from
date of acquisition in May 2000. Results for 1999 included TXU Australia Gas
from its February 24, 1999 acquisition date and acquisition-related costs
totaling $17 million after tax. Earnings also benefited from additional income
from the Western Underground Gas Storage (WUGS) facility, and a gain from the
sale of its construction and engineering business, Enetech, in January 2000.

   Operating revenues rose from A$1.1 billion ($682 million) in 1999 to A$1.2
billion ($717 million) in 2000, an increase of 17%. The increase is primarily
due to a full year of operations of TXU Australia Gas, results of Optima from
date of acquisition and new gas sales contracts entered into in 2000.
Partially offsetting these items were decreases in electric revenues due to
the competitive pressures experienced with electric customer contract renewals
in July 2000 and lower construction revenues due to the sale of Enetech.

   Energy purchased for resale increased from A$415 million ($268 million) in
1999 to A$575 million ($332 million) in 2000. The A$160 million ($64 million)
increase is due to higher volumes of gas sales as a result of new gas
contracts and higher purchased electricity as a result of higher electricity
pool prices. Operation and maintenance expenses decreased from A$335 million
($216 million) in 1999 to A$245 million ($141 million) in 2000 due to cost
savings achieved from post integration of natural gas operations and the sale
of Enetech. Depreciation and amortization, including goodwill amortization,
increased from A$119 million ($77 million) to A$139 million ($81 million) in
2000 primarily due to inclusion of TXU Australia Gas for a full year in 2000.

   Interest expense and other charges increased from A$203 million ($131
million) in 1999 to A$259 million ($151 million) in 2000 due to increases in
interest rates over 1999 and higher average debt balances primarily due to the
recent acquisitions.

   The effective income tax rate for the Australia segment was affected by
non-deductible goodwill amortization, other foreign permanent differences and
a reduction in the statutory tax rate in Australia.


                                     B-15
<PAGE>

1999 versus 1998

   TXU Australia had net income of $6 million for 1999 compared with $31
million for 1998. Results for 1999 were affected by very mild winter weather
and non-recurring charges totaling $17 million after-tax primarily for
integration and acquisition-related costs. Net income for 1999 includes the
results of TXU Australia Gas from date of acquisition on February 24, 1999.

   Operating revenues rose from A$696 million ($439 million) in 1998 to A$1.1
billion ($682 million) in 1999, an increase of 52%. The increase is primarily
due to revenues from TXU Australia Gas' distribution and retailing businesses
since acquisition, higher construction revenues and increased external
electricity network charges.

   Energy purchased for resale increased from A$265 million ($167 million) in
1998 to A$415 million ($268 million) in 1999. The A$150 million ($101 million)
increase includes A$110 million ($71 million) of gas purchase and distribution
costs associated with TXU Australia Gas, with the remainder of the increase
due to higher purchased electricity and distribution costs as a result of a 6%
increase in energy sold and higher electricity pool prices. Operation and
maintenance expenses increased from A$193 million ($121 million) in 1998 to
A$335 million ($216 million) in 1999 due to costs associated with TXU
Australia Gas' business and increased expenditures related to the construction
businesses. Depreciation and amortization, including goodwill amortization,
increased from A$68 million ($43 million) to A$119 million ($77 million) in
1999 primarily due to the TXU Australia Gas acquisition.

   Interest expense and other charges increased from A$94 million ($59
million) in 1998 to A$203 million ($131 million) in 1999 due to an increase in
outstanding debt resulting from the acquisition of TXU Australia Gas and the
initial payment under the agreement with AES Ecogen.

   The effective income tax rate for the Australia segment was affected by
non-deductible goodwill amortization and other foreign permanent differences.

Comprehensive Income
- - --------------------

   The losses from currency translation adjustments for all periods
principally reflect the substantial movement in exchange rates between the US
dollar and the UK pound sterling and the Australian dollar. The unrealized
holding gains (losses) on investments are primarily related to market changes
on investments held by TXU Europe and TXU Corp.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- - -------------------

Liquidity and Capital Resources --
- - -------------------------------

   Cash Flows -- Cash flows provided by operating activities before changes in
operating assets and liabilities for 2000 were $2.5 billion compared with $2.6
billion and $2.3 billion for 1999 and 1998, respectively. Changes in operating
assets and liabilities used cash of $820 million compared with $379 million
and $338 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in 2000 compared
to 1999 and 1998 is primarily due to the $650 million after-tax increase in
under-recovered fuel revenues as a result of the increase in natural gas
prices. TXU Corp. expects to recover fuel revenues through surcharges and
increases in the fuel factor on customer bills (See Regulation and Rates).
Other items effecting changes in operating assets and liabilities were higher
margin deposits and increases in trading receivables and payables due to the
increase in trading revenue of the US Energy segment.

   Cash flows used for investing activities for 2000 totaled $1.2 billion,
which are net of $1.4 billion provided from sales of assets and the
distribution received from the telecommunication joint venture. This compares
to $3.1 billion and $4.3 billion used for investing activities in 1999 and
1998, respectively, including $1.0 billion used for the acquisition of TXU
Australia Gas and $2.5 billion used

                                     B-16
<PAGE>

for the acquisition of TEG, respectively. Capital expenditures were $1.4
billion for 2000, compared with $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion for 1999 and
1998, respectively.

   Acquisitions and Dispositions -- TXU Electric has previously announced
plans to sell or swap certain natural gas-fired electricity generating plants
in Texas. At this time no such transactions have been finalized.

   In May 2000, TXU Gas sold substantially all of the assets of TXU Processing
Company, for $105 million.

   In May 2000, TXU Corp. acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fort Bend
Communications, Inc. (FBCC) for approximately $161 million in cash plus
liabilities assumed. In August 2000, TXU Corp. formed a joint venture with
other investors by contributing the stock of its telecommunications
subsidiaries, including FBCC, to Pinnacle One Partners, L.P. (Pinnacle or the
joint venture) for a 50% voting interest and a distribution of approximately
$600 million in cash. The other investors contributed $150 million for the
remaining 50% voting interest.

   In connection with the formation of Pinnacle and contribution of its
telecommunications subsidiaries, TXU Corp. issued a $336 million, 6.0% note
payable due in semi-annual installments to 2004.

   In May 2000, TXU Australia acquired certain assets and liabilities of
Optima from the government of South Australia for $177 million, including
certain acquisition costs. The purchase included a 100-year lease to operate a
1,280-megawatt natural gas fired generating station.

   In May 2000, TXU Europe sold its metering business in the UK for (Pounds)36
million ($54 million) in proceeds. In addition, in August 2000, TXU Europe
completed the sale of its interest in Severomoravska energetika, a.s. for
(Pounds)51 million ($76 million) in proceeds.

   In August 2000, TXU Europe purchased United Utilities plc's retail energy
supply business, Norweb Energi (a division of Norweb plc) for total
consideration, including direct costs of the acquisition, of (Pounds)340
million ($496 million). The transaction also includes the assumption of
certain of Norweb Energi's obligations, including its power purchase
agreements, which have been integrated into TXU Europe's energy portfolio.

   On January 8, 2001, TXU Europe completed the acquisition of 51% of
Stadtwerke Kiel AG (Kiel AG), a German municipal utility, for approximately
(Pounds)145 million ($218 million).

   On January 25, 2001, TXU Europe entered into a commitment to sell its 19.2%
interest in Hidrocantabrico to a consortium led by Electricidade de Portugal
S.A., the Portugese utility company, and Spanish savings bank, Caja de Ahorro
de Asturias (Cajastur). Electricidade de Portugal and Cajastur unconditionally
offered (Euro)24 ($22.60) per share for 100% of Hidrocantabrico.

   On February 1, 2001, TXU Europe announced it had agreed to sell its
interest in the North Sea gas fields for approximately (Pounds)138 million
($201 million) as part of its efforts to reposition its energy portfolio.

   In November 1999, TXU Europe formed a joint venture with certain
shareholders of Pohjolan Voima Oy (PVO), Finland's second largest electricity
generator. As part of the transaction, TXU Europe contributed approximately
(Euro)300 million ($308 million) for an 81% ownership interest in the joint
venture company, TXU Nordic Energy. In December 1999, TXU Europe completed the
acquisition of an approximate 40% interest in Savon Voima Oyj (SVO), for
approximately (Pounds)40 million ($65 million). The agreement includes an
option which allows the majority shareholders of SVO to require TXU Europe to
purchase the remaining 60% interest in SVO at prices that are based upon a
multiple of the original

                                     B-17
<PAGE>

purchase price for the first three years. After three years the purchase price
will be based upon a calculation which considers SVO's results of operations,
as well as cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt balances on hand at
the date the option is exercised. The option may be exercised at any time by
the majority shareholders and does not expire.

   TXU Corp. will pursue potential investment opportunities from time to time
when it concludes that such investments are consistent with its business
strategies and will dispose of nonstrategic assets in an effort to enhance the
long-term return to its shareholders. Proceeds from the sale of non-core
assets along with free cash flow are currently expected to be used primarily
for debt reduction.

   Future Capital Requirements -- TXU Corp.'s capital expenditures are
estimated at $1.6 billion for 2001 and will be funded by cash flows from
operations or external financing. Approximately 52% is planned for US Electric
and Gas operations, 6% for US Energy operations, 34% for operations in the UK
and continental Europe, and 8% for operations in Australia, telecommunications
and other activities. This amount includes approximately $500 million of
development expenditures.

   During 2000, TXU Corp. repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares of its
common stock for $596 million. Additional purchases may occur from time to
time. In addition common stock repurchasable under equity forward contracts
had a settlement value of $190 million at December 31, 2000.

   TXU Corp. or its predecessor have declared common stock dividends payable
in cash in each year since incorporation in 1945. The Board of Directors of
TXU Corp., at its February 2001 meeting, declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.60 a share, payable April 2, 2001 to shareholders of record on March 9,
2001. Future dividends may vary depending upon TXU Corp.'s profit levels and
capital requirements as well as financial and other conditions existing at the
time.

   TXU Corp. anticipates that, in connection with the business separation plan
required by the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, its subsidiaries will
refinance certain outstanding securities in the capital markets in order to
properly capitalize the separated businesses.

   External funds of a permanent or long-term nature are obtained through the
issuance of common, preference and preferred stock, TXU Corp. or subsidiary
obligated, mandatorily redeemable, preferred securities of subsidiary trusts,
each holding solely junior subordinated debentures of TXU Corp. or related
subsidiary (trust securities) and long-term debt by TXU Corp. The
capitalization ratios of TXU Corp. at December 31, 2000, consisted of
approximately 61.2% long-term debt (including equity-linked securities), 6.0%
trust securities, .8% preferred stock, .8% common stock repurchasable under
equity forward contracts, 1.2% preference stock and 30.0% common stock equity.
Restricted cash of $1.0 billion included in other investments collateralizes
certain TXU Europe capital lease obligations. Offsetting the cash pledge
against lease obligations, the capitalization ratios consisted of 59.6% long-
term debt, 6.2% trust securities, .9% preferred stock, .8% common stock
repurchasable under equity forward contracts, 1.3% preference stock and 31.2%
common stock equity.

   See Notes to Financial Statements for further details concerning short-term
financing, long-term debt, trust securities and preferred stock of
subsidiaries. Early redemptions of preferred stock and long-term debt may
occur from time to time in amounts presently undetermined.

   Financing Arrangements -- TXU Corp., TXU Electric, TXU Gas and other
subsidiaries of TXU Corp. may issue additional debt and equity securities as
needed, including the possible future sale: (i) by TXU Electric of up to $25
million of Cumulative Preferred Stock and an aggregate of $924 million of
Cumulative Preferred Stock, First Mortgage Bonds, debt securities and/or
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, and (ii) by TXU Gas of up to $400
million of debt securities and/or preferred securities of subsidiary trusts,
all of which are currently registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for offering pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933.
In addition, TXU Corp. may issue up to $340 million of debt securities and up
to an aggregate of $335 million of debt securities, preference stock, and/or
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts, all of which are currently
registered with the SEC for offering pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities

   At December 31, 2000, TXU Corp., TXU Electric and TXU Gas Company had joint
US dollar-denominated lines of credit under revolving credit facility
agreements (US Credit Agreements) with a group of banking institutions. At
December 31, 2000, TXU Corp. had no borrowings outstanding under these
facilities. The US Credit Agreements were amended in February 2001 and have
two facilities. Facility A provides for short-term borrowings aggregating up
to $1.4 billion outstanding at any one time at variable interest rates and
terminates in February 2002. Facility B provides for borrowings aggregating up
to $1.4 billion outstanding at any one time at variable interest rates and
terminates in February 2005. Facility B also provides for the issuance of up
to $500 million of letters of credit of which $224 million was outstanding at
December 31, 2000. TXU Electric's and TXU Gas' borrowings under both
facilities are limited to aggregate amounts outstanding at any one time of $2
billion and $650 million, respectively.

   At December 31, 2000, TXU Europe had a (Euro)2.0 billion Euro Medium Term
Note (EMTN) program, under which, TXU Europe may from time to time issue notes
in various currencies. On November 30, 2000, a financing subsidiary of TXU
Europe issued (Pounds)301 million of 35 Put 5 Resettable Notes due
2035 (Resettable Notes) under amended terms and conditions of the EMTN
program. The initial interest rate to the first reset date of November 30,
2005, is 7.7875%. The issuer of the Resettable Notes has an option to
repurchase the Resettable Notes at par on November 30, 2005. This call option
has been assigned to commercial banks for a consideration of approximately
(Pounds)5 million per annum for five years. The Resettable Notes also include
a put option that is exercisable at 5 years by the holder and a reset feature
that permits the holder to remarket the Resettable Notes at a different
interest rate if the put is not exercised. On the reset date, the new interest
rate will be determined in accordance with the terms of the Resettable Notes
for the next 6 to 20 years. The Resettable Notes can be redeemed at principal
plus accrued interest on November 30, 2005. A portion of the proceeds from the
Resettable Notes was used to repay the (Pounds)190 million ($284 million) rent
factoring agreement of TXU Europe on January 19, 2001. As of December 31,
2000, there was also (Pounds)275 million in 7.25% Sterling Eurobonds due
March 8, 2030 and (Pounds)100 million of 6.88% EMTN Notes due September 4,
2001 outstanding under this program.

   At December 31, 2000, TXU Europe had a joint sterling-denominated line of
credit with a group of banking institutions under a credit facility agreement
(Sterling Credit Agreement) that provides for borrowings of up to
(Pounds)1.075 billion and has two facilities: a (Pounds)750 million term
facility and a (Pounds)325 million revolving credit facility (Tranche B), both
of which terminate on March 2, 2003. The Sterling Credit Agreement allows for
borrowings in various currencies with interest rates based on the prevailing
rates in effect in the countries in which the borrowings originate. In August
2000, TXU Europe entered into a new (Pounds)300 million ($448 million) 364-day
short-term financing facility. As of December 31, 2000, the outstanding
Tranche B borrowings and interest rates in effect at December 31, 2000
consisted of 700 million Norwegian kroner (NOK) ($79 million) at 8.10% per
annum and (Euro)267 million ($252 million) at 5.80% per annum.

   On January 8, 2001, in connection with the acquisition of Kiel AG, TXU
Europe borrowed an additional (Euro)229 million ($219 million) at 5.54% per
annum ((Euro)47 million ($45 million) under Tranche B and (Euro)182 million
($174 million) under the 364-day facility). An additional NOK 50 million ($6
million) was borrowed under Tranche B on January 15, 2001.

   As of December 31, 2000, TXU Europe had several short-term facilities with
commercial banks which provide for borrowings in various currency
denominations and at current interest rates generally based on LIBOR. These
facilities expire between 2001 and 2003. Eastern Electricity's separate
revolving credit short-term facility was reduced in 2000 to a (Pounds)150
million limit. At December 31, 2000, outstanding borrowings under these short-
term facilities consisted of (Euro)506 million ($477 million) at 5.8%, 1.3
billion Czech koruna ($34 million) at 6.08% and (Pounds)150 million ($224
million) at 6.28%.

   TXU Electric has facilities with financial institutions whereby it is
entitled to sell and such financial institutions may purchase, on an ongoing
basis, undivided interests in customer accounts receivable representing up to
an aggregate of $500 million. TXU Gas has a similar facility for $100 million.
TXU Europe has facilities with a third party whereby Eastern Electricity may
sell up to (Pounds)300 million ($448 million) of its electricity receivables
and a finance subsidiary may borrow up to an aggregate of (Pounds)275 million
($411 million), collateralized by future receivables, with an overall program
limit of (Pounds)550 million ($821 million). Additional receivables are
continually sold to replace those collected. At December 31, 2000, accounts
receivable of TXU Electric were reduced by $500 million, TXU Gas' were reduced
by $100 million and Eastern Electricity's were reduced by (Pounds)164 million
($245 million) to reflect the sales of receivables under their programs and
(Pounds)5 million ($7 million) of short-term loans were outstanding
collateralized by future receivables.

   TXU Electric has filed a petition with the PUC for a financing order to
permit the issuance of transition bonds secured by payments designed to enable
TXU Electric to recover its generation-related regulatory assets and other
qualified costs in accordance with the 1999 Restructuring Legislation. The
proceeds received by TXU Electric from the issuance of the transition bonds
are to be used solely for the purpose of retiring utility debt and equity. For
more information concerning securitization of regulatory assets, see Note 13
to Financial Statements.

   ENERGY PRICE RISK -- Non-trading Activities -- In the UK and Australia,
electricity prices are established through power pools which are controlled
through an agreement with the licensed generators and suppliers in the case of
the UK, or by a statutory, independent corporation in the case of Australia.
In both cases, substantially all power generated must be sold into and
purchased from wholesale electricity trading pools. In order to manage the
exposure to fluctuations in electricity pool prices, both TXU Europe and TXU
Australia enter into both short- and long-term derivative instruments whereby
the pool price is fixed for an agreed-upon quantity and duration by reference
to an agreed-upon strike price. In the US, as a result of continued
regulation, TXU Electric and TXU Gas have minimal exposure to energy price
risk, therefore, their use of derivative instruments is limited.

   UK -- The hypothetical loss in fair value of TXU Europe's contracts for
differences, electricity forward agreements and other contracts in existence
at December 31, 2000 and 1999 entered into for non-trading purposes arising
from a 10% adverse movement in future electricity prices is estimated at
(Pounds)272 million ($406 million) and (Pounds)21 million ($34 million),
respectively. This hypothetical loss is calculated by modeling the contracts
against an internal forecast of Pool prices using discounted cash flow
techniques. The increase in the hypothetical market movement results from the
increase in energy purchase commitments during 2000, mainly relating to the
Norweb Energi acquisition, which were mostly above market rates at
acquisition. As these non-trading contracts are used to hedge sales to retail
customers, any adverse movement in wholesale electricity prices does not
directly affect the performance or profitability of TXU Europe, which is more
affected by price movements in retail markets.

   Australia -- The hypothetical loss in fair value of TXU Australia's
contracts for differences, electricity forward agreements and other contracts
in existence at December 31, 2000 and 1999 entered into for non-trading
purposes arising from a 10% adverse movement in future electricity prices is
estimated at A$2 million ($1 million) and A$12 million ($8 million),
respectively. This hypothetical loss is calculated by modeling the contracts
against an internal forecast of Pool prices using discounted cash flow
techniques.

   ENERGY PRICE RISK -- Trading Activities -- TXU Corp. has further positioned
itself to provide comprehensive energy products and services to a diversified
client base in the US, Europe and Australia. In the US, TXU Energy Trading
continues to engage in risk management activities, including the purchase and
sale of physical commodities and entering into futures contracts, other
forward commitments, swap agreements, exchange traded options, over-the-
counter options which are net settled or physically settled, exchange-of-
futures-for physical transactions, energy exchange transactions, storage
activities, and other contractual arrangements.

                                     B-22
<PAGE>

   Since 1999, TXU Europe and TXU Australia have been offering price risk
management services to customers through a variety of financial and other
instruments including contracts for differences (swaps), virtual power
stations, written options and forward contracts. TXU Europe trades both in the
UK market, where it seeks to take advantage of market conditions by extending
or shortening the size of its portfolio of purchase and sale commitments, and
in continental Europe, where it enters into financial instruments in markets
where it has no physical assets or retail volumes.

   The trading subsidiaries all manage the market risk of trading activities
on a portfolio basis within limitations imposed by their respective Boards of
Directors and in accordance with TXU Corp.'s overall risk management policies.
Market risks are monitored daily, utilizing appropriate mark-to-market
methodologies, which value the portfolio of contracts and the hypothetical
effect on this value from changes in market conditions. Each entity uses
various techniques and methodologies that simulate forward price curves in
their respective markets to estimate the size and probability of changes in
market value resulting from price movements. These techniques include, but are
not limited to, sensitivity analyses. The use of these methodologies requires
a number of key assumptions including the selection of confidence levels, the
holding period of the positions, and the depth and applicability to future
periods of historical price information.

   The portfolio subjects the entities to a number of risks and costs
associated with the future contractual commitments, including price risk,
credit risk associated with counterparties, product location (basis)
differentials and market liquidity. Each entity continuously monitors the
valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio valuation based on
present market conditions. Reserves are established in recognition that
certain risks exist until delivery of energy has occurred, counterparties have
fulfilled their financial commitments and related financial instruments mature
or are closed out. Price and credit risk are further managed within the
established trading policies and limits established for each trading entity
which are evaluated on a daily basis.

   US -- TXU Energy Trading uses market-implied volatilities to determine its
exposure to market risk. Market risk is estimated as the potential loss in
fair value resulting from at least a 15% change in market factors, which may
differ from actual results. Using a two standard deviation change, the most
adverse change in fair value at December 31, 2000 and 1999, as a result of
this analysis, was a reduction of $1.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

   UK -- The hypothetical loss in fair value of TXU Europe's forwards,
options, contracts for differences and other energy (electricity or gas)
commodity contracts in existence at December 31, 2000 and 1999 entered into
for trading purposes, arising from a 10% adverse movement in future prices, is
estimated at (Pounds)54 million ($81 million) and (Pounds)4 million ($6
million), respectively.

   Australia -- The hypothetical loss in fair value of TXU Australia's trading
contracts and other energy purchase contracts in existence at December 31,
2000 and 1999 entered into for trading purposes arising from a 10% adverse
movement in future electricity prices is estimated at A$60 million ($35
million) and A$31 million ($20 million), respectively.

Regulation and Rates

   US -- Electric Industry Restructuring -- Project teams have been
established to prepare TXU Electric and TXU SESCO for a competitive
environment. These teams are comprised of resources from all facets of TXU
Corp.'s business and formulate short- and long-term strategy to address the
implementation of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation.

   Fuel Cost Recovery Rule -- Pursuant to a PUC rule, the recovery of TXU
Electric's eligible fuel costs is provided through fixed fuel factors. The
rule allows a utility's fuel factor to be revised upward or downward every six
months, according to a specified schedule. A utility is required to petition
to

                                     B-23
<PAGE>

make either surcharges or refunds to ratepayers, together with interest based
on a twelve-month average of prime commercial rates, for any material
cumulative under- or over-recovery of fuel costs. If the cumulative difference
of the under- or over-recovery, plus interest, exceeds 4% of the annual
estimated fuel costs most recently approved by the PUC, it will be deemed to
be material.

   Final reconciliation of fuel costs must be made either in a reconciliation
proceeding or in a general rate case. In a final reconciliation, a utility has
the burden of proving that fuel costs under review were reasonable and
necessary to provide reliable electric service, that it has properly accounted
for its fuel-related revenues, and that fuel prices charged to the utility by
an affiliate were reasonable and necessary and not higher than prices charged
for similar items by such affiliate to other affiliates or nonaffiliates. For
generating utilities like TXU Electric, through August 31, 1999, the rule
provided for recovery of purchased power capacity costs through a power cost
recovery factor with respect to purchases from qualifying facilities, to the
extent such costs were not otherwise included in base rates. Pursuant to the
1999 Restructuring Legislation, the power cost recovery factor will be frozen
between September 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. The energy-related costs of
such purchases continue to be included in the fixed fuel factor. TXU Electric
is required to file in 2002 with the PUC for final reconciliation of its
eligible fuel costs. This final reconciliation will cover the period from July
1998 through December 2001. See Note 13 to Financial Statements.

   TXU Gas Distribution employs a continuing program of rate review for all
classes of customers in its regulatory jurisdictions. Rate relief amounting to
about $19.8 million in annualized revenue increases, exclusive of changes in
gas costs, was granted in 2000 in addition to about $7.5 million granted in
1999 and $2.5 million granted in 1998. Rate cases supporting $18.5 million in
annualized revenue increases were filed in 178 cities as of March 2, 2001. On
November 20, 2000, the RRC issued a final order in the appeal by the three
cities in the Dallas Distribution System. The final order approved a rate
increase of $2.6 million for residential and commercial customers, and this
amount is included in the total rate relief of $19.8 million for 2000. The RRC
also approved recovery of approximately $2.1 million in expenses related to
the case. Weather normalization adjustment clauses which allow rates to be
adjusted to reflect the impact of warmer-or colder-than-normal weather during
the winter months, reducing the impact of variations in weather on Gas
Distribution's earnings, have been approved by 320 cities served by TXU Gas
Distribution, representing 79% of TXU Gas Distribution's residential and
commercial sales volumes. These clauses allow rates to be adjusted to reflect
the impact of warmer- or colder-than-normal weather during the winter months,
minimizing the impact of variations in weather on TXU Gas Distribution's
earnings.

   In October 1999, TXU Lone Star Pipeline filed with the RRC a Statement of
Intent to change the city gate rate for gas transported for subsequent
distribution to residential and commercial customers. The filing requested a
general increase in annual revenues of approximately $20 million. In June
2000, the RRC issued a final ruling on TXU Lone Star Pipeline's requested gate
rate increase that denied the increase and resulted in a $1.5 million
reduction in the city gate rate, but granted favorable changes to its tariff
structure.

   TXU Electric and certain other regulated subsidiaries of TXU Corp. have
several rate requests or refunds pending or on appeal, see Note 13 to
Financial Statements.

   Europe -- The regulation of distribution and supply charges is currently
subject to review by OFGEM. In December 1999, OFGEM issued a final report,
proposing a range of substantial net revenue reductions for the distribution
businesses of all regional electricity companies in the UK. The final
proposals for Eastern Electricity incorporated an initial reduction in allowed
revenues for regulated units of 28% beginning April 1, 2000 with further
annual reductions of 3% for the next four years, adjusted for inflation. TXU
Europe estimates that the effect on distribution revenues was a reduction of
about (Pounds)65 million ($99 million), adjusted for inflation, in 2000 and is
estimated to be a further reduction of about (Pounds)30 million ($45 million)
in 2001.

   Electricity supply price controls became effective on April 1, 2000. The
directly controlled tariffs were reduced by an average of 7.1% from April 1,
2000 as required by the new controls. TXU Europe estimates that the effect on
electricity supply revenues was a reduction in annual revenues of
approximately (Pounds)15 million ($23 million). As the market is opened
further to competition, it is expected that price restraints will no longer be
applied to domestic customers. The DGES has indicated that he hopes to be able
to remove price controls effective April 1, 2002.

   Australia -- TXU Australia is subject to regulation by the Office of the
Regulator General (ORG). On September 21, 2000, the ORG published its final
decision in the 2001 Electricity Distribution Price Review. The decision will
cause TXU Australia Electricity's distribution revenue for 2001 to be
approximately A$16 million ($9 million) lower than for 2000. TXU Australia
appealed the decision to the ORG Appeal Panel on October 2, 2000. The price
path for TXU Networks (Electricity)s' distribution tariffs effective from
January 1, 2001 until at least December 31, 2005 was redetermined on December
1, 2000. The redetermination was required by directions from an Appeal Panel
on a number of appeals by three of the other Victorian distribution
businesses. TXU has challenged the determination and the redetermination in
the Victorian Supreme Court on the grounds that they do not comply with the
requirement of 5.10 (a) of the Tariff Order. That requirement requires the ORG
to utilize price-based regulation adopting a CPI-X approach and not to utilize
rate of return regulation. The appeal is currently scheduled to be heard
during March 2001.

   Voluntary maximum retail prices for electricity customers with usage below
160 MWh/year, have been announced by TXU Australia. Retail prices for non-
franchise customers are subject to competitive forces and are not regulated.
Customers who use 40 MWh per year or more have been able to choose their
retailer since January 1, 2001. The retail price will remain regulated for all
remaining electricity customers until they become able to purchase from
retailers of their choice, which is expected to be January 1, 2002. Based on
information available from the experience of mass-market competition in other
industries and other countries. TXU Australia expects that the competition
will be less intense for these smaller customers.

   The distribution tariffs applying to TXU Networks (Gas) are effective until
December 31, 2002, at which time a price review process will occur prior to
new tariffs being approved by the ORG for the next five-year period. After the
next period, prices will be set for periods nominated by TXU Networks (Gas)
and approved by ORG. TXU Australia is not able to predict the outcome of this
review or the impact on its financial position or results of operations.

   Gas retail customers with loads above 460,000 Mcf/year are currently
subject to competition. Customers with loads between 4,600 Mcf/year and
460,000 Mcf/year will be able to choose their retailers after September 1,
2001 and the remaining customers after May 1, 2001. While the market is
expected to be competitive, TXU Australia does not expect the same intensity
of competition in the early stages of competition as has been experienced in
electricity in Victoria. The most profitable segment of the retail gas market
in Victoria is the class of customers with load below 4,600 Mcf/year. As with
competition in the electric industry, TXU Australia's expectation is that the
competition, and therefore the downward pressure on margins, will be less
intense for these smaller customers.

   The State of Texas is transitioning to deregulation with adequate
generation capability and sound enabling legislation. The State of California,
however, has for several months suffered from transition to deregulation in an
environment of insufficient energy supply compounded by escalating natural gas
costs. This situation has financially distressed California utilities.
Although management of TXU Corp. believes it has appropriate credit reserves
in general, and limited direct exposure to these utilities, the effects the
California situation may have on energy trading counterparties, legislation
and the capital markets cannot be predicted.

   Although TXU Corp. cannot predict future regulatory or legislative actions
or any changes in economic and securities market conditions, no changes are
expected in trends or commitments, other than those discussed in this report,
which might significantly alter its basic financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. (See Note 14 to the Financial Statements.)

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), as extended by
SFAS No. 137 (June 1999) and amended by SFAS 138 (June 2000), is effective for
TXU Corp. beginning January 1, 2001. SFAS No.133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It
requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the
measurement of those instruments at fair value.

   All derivatives within TXU Corp. have been identified pursuant to SFAS No.
133 requirements. TXU Corp. has designated, documented and assessed hedging
relationships, which resulted in cash-flow hedges that require TXU Corp. to
record the derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on its balance
sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income. Future hedge
ineffectiveness will be recorded in earnings. Certain of TXU Corp.'s
derivatives relate to its trading activities, which TXU Corp. globally
accounts for on a mark-to-market basis, that are not affected by the
implementation of SFAS No. 133.

   Ongoing implementation issues currently being addressed by the Derivatives
Implementation Group (DIG) may affect the application of SFAS No. 133. In its
normal course of business, TXU Corp. enters into commodity contracts, which
include "swing" components for additional purchases or sales of the underlying
commodity. These contracts are used by TXU Corp. and its customers to provide
some of their commodity requirements. TXU Corp. has evaluated these contracts
and determined that they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception
provided by SFAS No. 133. In October 2000, the DIG reached a tentative
conclusion that option contracts, which could potentially include these
commodity "swing" contracts, do not qualify for such exception. If the FASB
approves this tentative conclusion, these contracts would be required to be
accounted for as derivatives. DIG conclusions are required to be prospectively
applied only after FASB approval.

   Adoption of this accounting standard as of January 1, 2001 resulted in the
recognition of $270 million of derivative assets and $393 million of
derivative liabilities with a cumulative effect of $85 million after-tax as a
decrease to other comprehensive income. TXU Corp. is unable to determine the
precise impact related to the commodity contracts discussed above until such
time as the FASB has approved the tentative conclusion and TXU Corp. has had
time to evaluate the effect. TXU Corp. estimates that the tentative conclusion
would increase other comprehensive income at January 1, 2001 by $22 million
after-tax.

   There are a number of issues pending before the DIG that may have an impact
on the application of this statement. Management is unable to predict the
outcome of these issues.

   SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfer and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities", is effective for TXU Corp. for transfers
on or after April 1, 2001. SFAS No. 140 replaces SFAS No. 125. SFAS No. 140
revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers
of financial assets and collateral and requires disclosures, but carries over
most of SFAS No. 125's provisions without reconsideration. TXU Corp. is
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its
sale of receivables program. SFAS No. 140 requires TXU Corp. to provide
certain disclosures about securitizations in the financial statements at
December 31, 2000. These disclosures have been incorporated.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

   This report and other presentations made by TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries
(collectively, TXU Corp.) contain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Although TXU Corp. believes that in making any such statement its expectations
are based on reasonable assumptions, any such statement involves uncertainties
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the following important
factors, among others, that could cause the actual results of TXU Corp. to
differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements: (i)
prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions, including those of
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the PUC, the Railroad
Commission of Texas (RRC), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Office
of the Regulator General of Victoria, Australia, and the Office of Gas and
Electricity Markets covering England, Wales and Scotland (OFGEM) in the UK
with respect to allowed rates of return, industry and rate structure,
purchased power and investment recovery, operations of nuclear generating
facilities, acquisitions and disposal of assets and facilities, operation and
construction of plant facilities, decommissioning costs, present or
prospective wholesale and retail competition, changes in tax laws and policies
and changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies,
(ii) weather conditions and other natural phenomena, (iii) unanticipated
population growth or decline, and changes in market demand and demographic
patterns, (iv) competition for retail and wholesale customers, (v) pricing and
transportation of crude oil, natural gas and other commodities, (vi)
unanticipated changes in interest rates, rates of inflation or foreign
exchange rates, (vii) unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital
expenditures, (viii) capital market conditions, (ix) competition for new
energy development opportunities, (x) legal and administrative proceedings and
settlements, (xi) inability of the various counterparties to meet their
obligations with respect to TXU Corp.'s financial instruments, (xii) changes
in technology used and services offered by TXU Corp., and (xiii) significant
changes in TXU Corp.'s relationship with its employees and the potential
adverse effects if labor disputes or grievances were to occur.

   Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such
statement is made, and TXU Corp. undertakes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on
which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for TXU
Corp. to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each
such factor or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may
cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statement.

                          TXU CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                          STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY

   The management of TXU Corp. is responsible for the preparation, integrity
and objectivity of the consolidated financial statements of TXU Corp. and its
subsidiaries and other information included in this report. The consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As appropriate,
the statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of
management.

   The management of TXU Corp. has established and maintains a system of
internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance, on a cost-effective
basis, that assets are safeguarded, transactions are executed in accordance
with management's authorization and financial records are reliable for
preparing consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the
system of control provides reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities
that could be material to the consolidated financial statements are prevented
or would be detected within a timely period. Key elements in this system
include the effective communication of established written policies and
procedures, selection and training of qualified personnel and organizational
arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility. This
system of control is augmented by an ongoing internal audit program designed
to evaluate its adequacy and effectiveness. Management considers the
recommendations of the internal auditors and independent auditors concerning
TXU Corp.'s system of internal control and takes appropriate actions which are
cost-effective in the circumstances. Management believes that, as of December
31, 2000, TXU Corp.'s system of internal control was adequate to accomplish
the objectives discussed herein.

   The Board of Directors of TXU Corp. addresses its oversight responsibility
for the consolidated financial statements through its Audit Committee, which
is composed of directors who are not employees of TXU Corp. The Audit
Committee meets regularly with TXU Corp.'s management, internal auditors and
independent auditors to review matters relating to financial reporting,
auditing and internal control. To ensure auditor independence, both the
internal auditors and independent auditors have full and free access to the
Audit Committee.

   The independent auditing firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP is engaged to audit,
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America, the consolidated financial statements of TXU Corp. and its
subsidiaries and to issue their report thereon.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TXU Corp.:

   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TXU Corp.
(the Company), formerly known as Texas Utilities Company, and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related statements of consolidated
income, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the consolidated financial statements of TXU
Europe Limited, (a consolidated subsidiary) for the year ended December 31,
1998, which statements reflect total revenues constituting 24% of consolidated
total revenues for that year. Those statements were audited by other auditors
whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates
to the amounts included for TXU Europe Limited, is based solely on the report
of such other auditors.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

   In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors,
such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of TXU Corp. and subsidiaries at December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of TXU Europe Limited (formerly
known as TXU Eastern Holdings Limited) and Subsidiaries:

   In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of consolidated
income, of comprehensive income, of common stock equity and of cash flows for
the period from formation (February 5, 1998) to December 31, 1998 present
fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of
TXU Europe Limited (formerly known as TXU Eastern Holdings Limited) and
Subsidiaries for the period from formation (February 5, 1998) to December 31,
1998, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the
United Kingdom which do not differ significantly with those in the United
States and which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                          TXU CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.BUSINESS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

   In May 2000, Texas Utilities Company changed its corporate name to TXU
Corp. TXU Corp., a Texas corporation, is a holding company whose principal
United States (US) operations are conducted through TXU Electric Company (TXU
Electric), TXU Gas Company (TXU Gas), TXU Energy Services Company and TXU
Energy Trading Company (TXU Energy Trading). TXU Corp.'s principal
international operations are conducted through TXU International Holdings
Limited (TXU International Holdings), which in turn indirectly owns TXU Europe
Limited (TXU Europe) and TXU Australia Holdings (Partnership) Limited
Partnership (TXU Australia).

   TXU Corp. engages in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution
and sale of electricity; the purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of
natural gas; and energy marketing, energy services, telecommunications; and
other businesses.

   In May 1998, TXU Corp. acquired The Energy Group PLC (TEG), the former
holding company of TXU Europe Plc for $7.4 billion. TXU Corp. recorded its
approximate 22% equity interest in the net income of TEG for the period from
March 1998 to May 19, 1998 and has accounted for TEG and TXU Europe as
consolidated subsidiaries since May 19, 1998. The excess of the purchase
consideration plus acquisition costs over the net fair value of tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, reflecting
final purchases adjustments, resulted in goodwill of (Pounds)3.6 billion ($5.8
billion), which is being amortized over 40 years.

   In February 1999, TXU Australia acquired from the Government of Victoria,
Australia, the gas retail business of TXU Pty. Ltd. and the gas distribution
operations of TXU Networks (Gas) Pty. Ltd. (together, TXU Australia Gas). The
purchase price was A$1.6 billion ($1.0 billion). Goodwill resulting from the
acquisition of A$751 million ($475 million) is being amortized over 40 years.

   In April 2000, TXU Europe and EDF London Investments plc, a subsidiary of
Electricite de France, began operation of an equally-held joint venture named
"24seven", for the management, operation and maintenance of their
subsidiaries' respective electricity distribution networks. TXU Europe
accounts for its investment in 24seven by the equity method of accounting.
Employees of the joint venturers' subsidiaries, Eastern Electricity and London
Electricity plc, were transferred to 24seven. The physical distribution system
assets, as well as all operating licenses, continue to be owned separately by
Eastern Electricity and London Electricity plc.

   In May 2000, TXU Corp. acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fort Bend
Communications, Inc. (FBCC) for approximately $161 million in cash plus
liabilities assumed. In August 2000, TXU Corp. formed a joint venture with
other investors and contributed the stock of its telecommunications
subsidiaries, including FBCC, to Pinnacle One Partners, L.P. (Pinnacle or the
joint venture) for a 50% voting interest and a distribution of approximately
$600 million in cash. The other investors contributed $150 million for the
remaining 50% voting interest. TXU Corp.'s telecommunications subsidiaries
contributed to the joint venture are no longer consolidated, and TXU Corp.'s
investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method.
Assets of the joint venture are not TXU Corp.'s and are not available to pay
creditors of TXU Corp. The book value of assets contributed was $741 million
and of liabilities assumed was $264 million.

   In May 2000, TXU Australia acquired certain assets and liabilities of
Optima Energy Pty Ltd (Optima) from the government of South Australia for
A$301 million ($177 million). The purchase included a 100-year lease to
operate a 1,280-megawatt natural gas-powered generating station. The excess of
the purchase price plus acquisition costs over a preliminary estimate of the
net fair value of

                                     B-36
<PAGE>

assets acquired resulted in goodwill of A$53 million ($31 million), which is
being amortized over 30 years. The goodwill amount is subject to revision as
additional information about the fair value of the assets acquired,
liabilities assumed and contingencies existing at the acquisition date is
evaluated.

   On January 8, 2001, TXU Europe completed the acquisition of 51% of
Stadtwerke Kiel AG, a German municipal utility, for approximately (Pounds)145
million ($218 million). At the date of acquisition, Kiel AG had recorded
sterling equivalent assets of approximately (Pounds)121 million ($182 million)
and liabilities of (Pounds)82 million ($123 million). The process of
determining the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed has not been completed.

   On January 25, 2001, TXU Europe entered into a commitment to sell its 19.2%
interest in Hidroelectrica del Cantabrico, SA (Hidrocantabrico) to a
consortium led by Electricidade de Portugal S.A., the Portugese utility
company, and Spanish savings bank, Caja de Ahorro de Asturias (Cajastur).
Electricidade de Portugal and Cajastur unconditionally offered (Euro)24
($22.60) per share for 100% of Hidrocantabrico. In March 2000, a subsidiary of
TXU Europe announced its intentions to make a cash offer to acquire all of the
shares of SA Hidrocantabrico that TXU Europe did not then own. Later in March
2000, after a competing bid had been issued, TXU Europe announced that it
would not pursue its offer. In a series of private transactions since that
date, TXU Europe acquired additional shares in Hidrocantabrico until it holds
approximately 19.2% of the outstanding shares. TXU Europe has pre-emptive
rights over 4.9% of the stock in Hidrocantabrico currently held by Electrabel
SA (Electrabel), an electricity company in Belgium, if Electrabel elects to
sell its interests in Hidrocantabrico to another company during a one year
period beginning July 4, 2000. TXU Europe is subject to a conditional put
option by which it can be required to purchase the 10% interest in
Hidrocantabrico held by Electrabel to the extent Electrabel is required to
dispose of its holding in Hidrocantabrico by the European Union or Spanish
Competition Authorities during a one year period beginning July 4, 2000. The
conditions of this put option include a reasonable notice period before
execution.

   In May 2000, TXU Gas sold substantially all of the assets of its natural
gas processing subsidiary, TXU Processing Company, for $105 million resulting,
in a pre-tax gain of $53 million ($34 million after-tax). In May 2000, TXU
Europe sold its metering business in the UK realizing a pretax gain of
approximately (Pounds)29 million ($44 million) ((Pounds)20 million ($31
million) after-tax). In addition, in August 2000, TXU Europe completed the
sale of its interest in Severomoravska energetika, a.s. (SME) for
(Pounds)51 million, realizing a pre-tax gain of approximately (Pounds)20
million ($30 million) ((Pounds)14 million ($21 million) after-tax. The
investment in SME was previously accounted for as an available-for-sale
marketable equity security, and the amount of holding gains that were
previously recorded in other comprehensive income has been reclassified as
realized gains. All of these sales have been recorded in other income
(deductions) -- net.

   In August 2000, TXU Europe purchased United Utilities plc's retail energy
supply business, Norweb Energi (a division of Norweb plc) for total
consideration, including direct costs of the acquisition, of (Pounds)340
million ($496 million). The transaction also includes the assumption of
certain of Norweb Energi's obligations, including its power purchase
agreements, which have been integrated into TXU Europe's energy portfolio.

   The acquisition of Norweb Energi is being accounted for as a purchase
business combination. The process of determining the fair value of assets and
liabilities of Norweb Energi has not been completed. The latest estimate of
the goodwill is (Pounds)622 million ($908 million) which is being amortized
over 20 years. This amount is subject to further revision, as additional
information about the fair value of Norweb Energi's assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at acquisition becomes available, primarily exit costs and
other liabilities assumed at acquisition.

                                     B-37

   The following summary of unaudited pro forma consolidated results of TXU
Corp.'s operations reflect the acquisition of Norweb Energi in 2000 and 1999
and TEG in 1998 as though they occurred at the beginning of those years.

</TABLE>

   These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what the actual
results would have been had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of these
periods. Further, the pro forma results are not intended to be a projection of
future results of the combined companies.

   Consolidated pro forma income and earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 1999, and 2000, assuming the acquisition of TXU Australia Gas and
Optima, respectively, had occurred at the beginning of the period, would not
have differed significantly from reported results.

2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of TXU Corp. and its majority owned subsidiaries, including its business
trusts. All intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for by
the equity method. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified
to conform to current classifications. All dollar amounts in the financial
statements and notes to financial statements, except per share amounts, are
stated in millions of US dollars unless otherwise indicated.

   Use of Estimates -- The preparation of TXU Corp.'s financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that
affect the reporting and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the balance
sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the
periods. In the event estimates and/or assumptions prove to be different from
actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more
current information. No material adjustments, other than those disclosed
elsewhere herein, were made to previous estimates during the current year.

   System of Accounts -- The accounting records of TXU Electric are maintained
in accordance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) Uniform
System of Accounts as adopted by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC).
The regulated operations of TXU Gas are subject to the accounting requirements
prescribed by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners
(NARUC). TXU Europe separately prepares regulatory accounts under accounting
requirements specified by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets.

   Marketable Securities -- TXU Corp. and subsidiaries classify all of their
marketable securities as available for sale. Available for sale securities are
carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported in other
comprehensive income (loss). Declines in fair value that are other than
temporary are reflected in income.

   Property, Plant and Equipment -- US electric and gas utility plant is
stated at original cost less certain regulatory disallowances. The cost of
transmission and distribution (T&D) property additions to US electric (and
generation prior to July 1, 1999) and gas utility plant includes labor and
materials,

                                     B-38
<PAGE>

applicable overhead and payroll-related costs and an allowance for funds used
during construction (AFUDC). Other property, including non-US property, is
stated at cost.

   Goodwill -- Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over
the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for
each company acquired and is being amortized over a range of 20 to 40 years.

   Valuation of long-lived assets -- TXU Corp. evaluates the carrying value of
goodwill and long-lived assets to be held and used when events and
circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of goodwill and long-
lived asset would be considered impaired when the projected undiscounted cash
flows are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss would be
recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
market value. Fair market value is determined primarily by available market
valuations or, if applicable, discounted cash flows.

   Regulatory Assets and Liabilities -- The financial statements of TXU
Corp.'s regulated businesses reflect regulatory assets and liabilities under
cost-based rate regulation in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 71, "Accounting for the Effect of Certain
Types of Regulation." As a result of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, the
electricity generation portion of TXU Electric's business no longer meets the
criteria to apply SFAS No. 71. (See Notes 3 and 13.)

   Derivative Instruments -- TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries use derivative
transactions for hedging purposes in non-trading activities. Amounts paid or
received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates
change and are recognized over the life of the agreements as adjustments to
interest expense. The impact of changes in the market value of non-trading
derivative instruments, or other contractual agreements in connection with the
wholesale purchases of electric energy by TXU Europe and TXU Australia, are
recognized when the related transaction is completed. TXU Corp., through its
energy marketing subsidiaries, TXU Energy Trading Company, TXU Europe Energy
Trading Limited and TXU Australia, enters into a variety of transactions,
involving physical commodity and derivative instruments. TXU Corp. uses the
mark-to-market method of accounting for trading activities. (See Note 11.) See
Changes in Accounting Standards below for the change in accounting for
derivatives effective January 1, 2001.

   Foreign Currency Translation -- The assets and liabilities of non-US
operations denominated in local currencies are translated at rates in effect
at year end. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the
applicable periods. Generally, local currencies are considered to be the
functional currency, and adjustments resulting from such translation are
included in other comprehensive income (loss).

   Revenues -- Electric and gas sales revenues are recognized when services
are provided to customers on the basis of periodic cycle meter readings and
include an estimated accrual for the value of electricity and gas provided
from the meter reading date to the end of the month. US electric and gas
revenues include billings under approved rates and adjustments under various
mechanisms to recover or refund the cost of fuel and purchased power costs
that are above or below the level included in base rates. (See Note 13 for a
discussion of Regulations and Rates.)

   Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment -- Depreciation of TXU
Corp.'s property, plant and equipment is generally based upon an amortization
of the original cost of depreciable properties on a straight-line basis over
the estimated service lives of the properties. Depreciation also includes an
amount for decommissioning costs for TXU Electric's nuclear powered electric
generating station (Comanche Peak), which is being accrued over the lives of
the units. Consolidated depreciation as a percent of average depreciable
property for TXU Corp. approximated 3.2% for 2000, 3.6% for 1999 and 3.0% for
1998. The fair value of the acquired UK power stations under capital lease is
amortized to expense ratably over the remaining estimated economic lives of
the power stations, which extend to 2018. The successful efforts method was
used to account for UK natural gas fields prior to its sale in January 2001.
Depletion was charged on a unit-of-production basis.

                                     B-39
<PAGE>

   Amortization of Nuclear Fuel -- The amortization of nuclear fuel in the
reactors (net of regulatory disallowances) is calculated on the units-of-
production method and is included in nuclear fuel expense.

   Income Taxes -- TXU Corp. and its US subsidiaries file a consolidated
federal income tax return, and federal income taxes are allocated to
subsidiaries based upon their respective taxable income or loss. Investment
tax credits are amortized to income over the estimated service lives of the
properties. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences
between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Certain provisions
of SFAS No. 109 provide that regulated enterprises are permitted to recognize
such adjustments as regulatory tax assets or tax liabilities if it is probable
that such amounts will be recovered from, or returned to, customers in future
rates.

   Income Taxes on Undistributed Earnings of Non-US Subsidiaries -- TXU Corp.
intends to reinvest the earnings of its non-US subsidiaries into those
businesses. Accordingly, no provision has been made for taxes which would be
payable if such earnings were to be repatriated.

   Earnings Per Share -- Basic earnings per share applicable to common stock
are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year. Diluted earnings per share include the effect of potential common
shares resulting from the assumed exercise of all outstanding stock options,
settlement of forward stock purchase agreements and conversion of the
convertible subordinated debentures of TXU Gas for the period outstanding
(converted in 1998). For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998;
447,827; 193,194 and 677,269 shares, respectively, were added to the average
shares outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 1998, $0.9 million of
after-tax interest expense was added to earnings applicable to common stock
for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share.

   Consolidated Cash Flows -- For purposes of reporting cash and cash
equivalents, temporary cash investments purchased with a remaining maturity of
three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

   Changes in Accounting Standards -- SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS No. 133), as extended by SFAS No.
137 (June 1999) and amended by SFAS No. 138 (June 2000), is effective for TXU
Corp. beginning January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It
requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the
measurement of those instruments at fair value.

   All derivatives within TXU Corp. have been identified pursuant to SFAS No.
133 requirements. TXU Corp. has designated, documented and assessed hedging
relationships which, resulted in cash-flow hedges that require TXU Corp. to
record the derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on its balance
sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income. Future hedge
ineffectiveness will be recorded in earnings. Certain of TXU Corp.'s
derivatives relate to its trading activities, which TXU Corp. globally
accounts for on a mark-to-market basis, that are not affected by the
implementation of SFAS No. 133.

   Ongoing implementation issues currently being addressed by the Derivatives
Implementation Group (DIG) may affect the application of SFAS No. 133. In its
normal course of business, TXU Corp. enters into commodity contracts, which
include "swing" components for additional purchases or sales of the underlying
commodity. These contracts are used by TXU Corp. and its customers to provide
some of their commodity requirements. TXU Corp. has evaluated these contracts
and determined that they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception
provided by SFAS No. 133. In October 2000, the DIG reached a tentative
conclusion that option contracts, which could potentially include these
commodity "swing" contracts, do not qualify for such exception. If the FASB
approves this tentative conclusion, these contracts would be required to be
accounted for as derivatives. DIG conclusions are required to be prospectively
applied only after FASB approval.


                                     B-40
<PAGE>

   Adoption of this accounting standard as of January 1, 2001 resulted in the
recognition of $270 million of derivative assets and $393 million of
derivative liabilities with a cumulative effect of $85 million after-tax as a
decrease to other comprehensive income. TXU Corp. is unable to determine the
precise impact related to the commodity contracts discussed above until such
time as the FASB has approved the tentative conclusion and TXU Corp. has had
time to evaluate the effect. TXU Corp. estimates that the tentative conclusion
would increase other comprehensive income at January 1, 2001 by $22 million
after-tax.

   There are a number of other issues pending before the DIG that may have an
impact on the application of this statement. Management is unable to predict
the outcome of these issues.

   SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfer and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities", is effective for TXU Corp. for transfers
on or after April 1, 2001. SFAS No. 140 replaces SFAS No. 125. SFAS No. 140
revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers
of financial assets and collateral and requires disclosures, but carries over
most of SFAS No. 125's provisions without reconsideration. TXU Corp. is
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its
sale of receivables program. SFAS No. 140 requires TXU Corp. to provide
certain disclosures about securitizations in the financial statements at
December 31, 2000. These disclosures have been incorporated.

3. ACCOUNTING IMPACT OF THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY IN
   TEXAS

   Legislation was passed during the 1999 session of the Texas Legislature
that will restructure the electric utility industry in Texas (1999
Restructuring Legislation). Among other matters, the l999 Restructuring
Legislation provides that earnings in excess of a regulatory earnings cap, as
defined, be used as mitigation (reduction) to the cost of nuclear production
assets (see Note 13); authorizes competition in the retail and generation
markets for electricity beginning January 1, 2002; provides for the recovery
of generation-related regulatory assets, generation-related and purchased
power-related costs that are in excess of market value (stranded costs);
requires reductions in nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO\\2\\)
emissions; requires a rate freeze, excluding cost of fuel, for all retail
customers until January 1, 2002 and certain rate reductions for residential
and small commercial customers for up to five years thereafter; and sets
certain limits on capacity owned and controlled by power generation companies.
By September 1, 2000, each electric utility was required to separate from its
regulated activities its customer energy services business activities that are
otherwise already widely available in the competitive market. By January 1,
2002, each electric utility must separate (unbundle) its business into the
following units: a power generation company, a retail electric provider (REP)
and a T&D company or separate T&D companies. A power generation company
generates electricity that is intended to be sold at wholesale. In general, a
power generation company may not own a transmission or distribution facility
and may not have a certificated service area. REP sells electric energy to
retail customers and may not own or operate generation assets.

   Accounting Impact of the Restructuring -- Regulatory Assets and
Liabilities -- The financial statements of TXU Electric reflect regulatory
assets and liabilities under cost-based rate regulation in accordance with
SFAS No. 71. As a result of the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, the
electricity generation portion of TXU Electric's business no longer meets the
criteria to apply regulatory accounting principles. Accordingly, application
of SFAS No. 71 to the generation portion of TXU Electric's business was
discontinued as of June 30, 1999. TXU Electric's T&D operations continue to
meet the criteria for recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities. The
1999 Restructuring Legislation provides for the recovery of net generation-
related regulatory assets existing at December 31, 1998. Such generation-
related regulatory assets will be amortized as recovered through the
distribution portion of the business (See Note 13). In addition, fuel costs
will be fully recoverable,

                                     B-41
<PAGE>

subject to regulatory review, during the transition period that extends to
January 1, 2002. As a result, management believes the economic benefit of all
net regulatory assets related to the generation business will be recovered.

   Generation Production Assets -- TXU Electric anticipates that a portion of
the cost of its generation production assets and power purchase contracts may
be identified as stranded costs under the 1999 Restructuring Legislation and
become subject to a future quantification of the economic value of such assets
in 2004. The 1999 Restructuring Legislation provides that 100% of such
stranded costs will be recovered from customers. In 1999, TXU Electric
performed an impairment analysis of generation assets under the provisions of
SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 121 requires a company to
forecast future net cash flows from operating the asset, on an undiscounted
basis excluding carrying costs, and to compare the sum of those cash flows
with the net carrying value of the asset. Under this test, if the undiscounted
net cash flows exceed the net carrying value, no impairment exists for
accounting purposes. TXU Electric forecasted the net cash flows of its
generating assets and determined that the undiscounted net cash flows exceeded
the net carrying value of those plants. Accordingly, for accounting purposes,
there is no impairment. Generation-related plant assets at December 31, 2000
were approximately $9.5 billion, net of accumulated depreciation. See Notes 13
and 16 for further details concerning mitigation impacts.

   Investment Tax Credits -- TXU Electric has unamortized deferred investment
tax credits (ITCs) of approximately $410 million applicable to its generation
business. The unamortized ITCs are temporary differences for which a deferred
income tax asset and a related regulatory liability have been recorded. It is
uncertain under applicable regulations whether, and to what extent, the
customers will ultimately benefit from the unamortized ITCs and/or the related
regulatory liability. Upon final determination by the PUC, TXU Electric
expects that the amount of unamortized ITCs not applicable to customers will
be amortized over the remaining life of the generation plants. Also, upon
final determination by the PUC, TXU Electric expects that the regulatory
liability related to the ITCs that is not applicable to customers will be
written off as an extraordinary credit to income.

4. SHORT-TERM FINANCING

   At December 31, 2000, TXU Corp. had outstanding short-term borrowings
consisting of commercial paper of $1,906 million and bank borrowings of $1,266
million. During the years 2000 and 1999, TXU Corp.'s average amounts
outstanding for short-term borrowings were $3,451 million and $3,732 million,
respectively. Weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings were
6.97% and 6.04% at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

   At December 31, 2000, TXU Corp., TXU Electric and TXU Gas Company had joint
US dollar-denominated lines of credit under revolving credit facility
agreements (US Credit Agreements) with a group of banking institutions. At
December 31, 2000, TXU Corp. had no borrowings outstanding under these
facilities. The US Credit Agreements were amended in February 2001 and have
two facilities. Facility A provides for short-term borrowings aggregating up
to $1.4 billion outstanding at any one time at variable interest rates and
terminates in February 2002. Facility B provides for borrowings aggregating up
to $1.4 billion outstanding at any one time at variable interest rates and
terminates in February 2005. Facility B also provides for the issuance of up
to $500 million of letters of credit. Letters of credit outstanding under the
agreement totaled $224 million at December 31, 2000. TXU Electric's and TXU
Gas' borrowings under both facilities are limited to an aggregate amount
outstanding at any one time of $2 billion and $650 million, respectively.

   As of December 31, 2000, TXU Europe had several short-term facilities with
commercial banks which provide for borrowings in various currency
denominations and at current interest rates generally based on LIBOR. These
facilities expire between 2001 and 2003, including a new 364-day facility

                                     B-42
<PAGE>

which began in August 2000. One of these facilities, Eastern Electricity's
separate revolving credit short-term facility, was reduced in 2000 to a
(Pounds)150 million ($224 million) limit. At December 31, 2000, outstanding
borrowings under these short-term facilities consisted of (Euro)506 million
($477 million) at 5.8%, 1.3 billion Czech koruna ($34 million) at 6.08% and
(Pounds)150 million ($224 million) at 6.28%. These amounts are included in
bank borrowings on the balance sheet. On January 8, 2001, TXU Europe borrowed
an additional (Euro)182 million ($174 million) under the 364-day revolving
credit facility and on January 22, 2001 the (Pounds)150 million ($224 million)
Eastern Electricity revolving credit balance was repaid.

   TXU Europe has a facility with a third party whereby it may borrow up to
(Pounds)275 million, collateralized by future receivables of Eastern
Electricity through a short term note issue arrangement. At December 31, 2000,
borrowings of (Pounds)5 million ($7 million) were outstanding under this
facility which, is included in bank borrowings on the balance sheet. These
borrowings bear interest at 6.02% at December 31, 2000. The program has an
overall limit of (Pounds)550 million, including a (Pounds)300 million sale of
receivables program (see Note 16).

   TXU Australia bank borrowings at December 31, 2000 included A$58 million
($32 million) of working capital facilities, a A$413 million ($232 million)
Subordinated Acquisition Facility related to the acquisition of TXU Australia
Gas, and a A$120 million ($67 million) Senior Acquisition Facility related to
the acquisition of Optima. These amounts are included in bank borrowings on
the balance sheet. The interest rates on these borrowings were 7.135%, 7.568%,
and 7.062%, respectively. TXU Australia is required to provide letters of
credit in connection with its electricity and gas purchasing activities. Such
letters of credit in effect at December 31, 2000 totaled A$70 million ($39
million). At December 31, 2000, no amounts had been drawn under these letters
of credit.

(a) Interest rates in effect at December 31, 2000 are presented. Taxable
    pollution control series are in a flexible rate mode. Series 1993 bonds due
    2023 will be remarketed for periods of less than 270 days and are secured
    by an irrevocable letter of credit with a maturity in excess of one year.

(b) Interest rates in effect at December 31, 2000 are presented. These series
    are in a flexible mode with varying interest rates and, while in such mode,
    will be remarketed for periods of less than 270 days and are secured by
    irrevocable letters of credit with maturities in excess of one year.

(c) Interest rates in effect at December 31, 2000 are presented. These series
    are in a daily or multiannual mode with varying interest rates and are
    supported by either municipal bond insurance policies and standby bond
    purchase agreements or are secured by irrevocable letters of credit with
    maturities in excess of one year.

(d) In 1990, TXU Electric purchased the ownership interest in Comanche Peak of
    Tex-La Electric Cooperative of Texas, Inc. (Tex-La) and assumed debt of
    Tex-La payable over approximately 32 years. The assumption is secured by a
    mortgage on the acquired interest.

                                      B-44
<PAGE>

(e) In July 1998, the interest rate was reset to a fixed rate of 6.56% payable
    until July 1, 2005.

(f) Interest rate swaps effectively fix the rate on two series of floating
    rate senior notes maturing in 2001. One swap converts the interest rate to
    a fixed rate of 6.725% on the $425 million series and three swaps convert
    the interest rate to a weighted average rate of 6.447% on the $500 million
    series.

(g) TXU Europe has various interest rate and currency swaps in effect with an
    aggregate notional amount of $1.5 billion ((Pounds)921 million) that
    effectively convert fixed rate Senior Notes payable in US dollars to a
    fixed rate debt payable in pounds sterling. These swaps mature on the
    dates of the underlying notes and have a weighted average fixed pay rate
    of 6.61% plus a margin.

(h) Represents a Sterling Credit Agreement, which consists of a term loan of
    $1.1 billion with an interest rate of 6.815% and two drawings under the
    Tranche B Revolver in the total amount of $331 million with interest rates
    ranging from 5.80% to 8.10% at December 31, 2000. Interest rate swaps in
    place at December 31, 2000 convert a portion of the borrowings under the
    Sterling Credit Agreement to fixed rates, with notional amounts of
    (Pounds)400 million ($597 million) maturing 2003 at an average rate of
    6.71% and (Pounds)400 million ($597 million) maturing in 2008 at an
    average rate of 6.45%.

(i) At December 31, 2000, TXU Australia had interest rate swaps denominated in
    Australian dollars with an aggregate notional amount of A$2.0 billion
    ($1.1 billion) to swap floating rate interest to fixed rates at a weighted
    average fixed rate of 6.70%. In addition, TXU Australia had interest rate
    swaps denominated in US dollars with notional amounts of $250 million
    maturing in 2006 and $100 million maturing in 2016 to swap fixed rate
    interest to floating rates which, was 7.18% at December 31, 2000.

(j) Equity-linked securities consist of senior notes initially sold with
    purchase contracts under which the holder will purchase from TXU Corp. on
    settlement dates in 2001 and 2002, a number of its shares of common stock
    equal to a specified rate (based on a formula using the market price of
    TXU Corp.'s common stock). TXU Corp. has 50 million authorized shares of
    serial preference stock having a par value of $25 per share, none of which
    has been issued.

(k) The notes are mandatorily putable to a dealer for remarketing on October
    15, 2001. TXU Corp. will be required to repurchase the notes in the event
    they are not remarketed.


   The pollution control series variable rate debt of TXU Electric requires
periodic remarketing. Because TXU Electric intends to remarket these
obligations, and has the ability and intent to refinance if necessary, they
have been classified as long-term debt.

   On October 17, 2000, TXU Gas issued $200 million aggregate principal amount
of Putable Asset Term Securities due October 15, 2012. The securities have a
fixed rate of 7 5/8% from the date of issuance through October 14, 2002. TXU
Gas also assigned to a third party the right to call the securities. On
October 15, 2002, the securities will be either mandatorily tendered to and
purchased by the callholder or mandatorily redeemed by TXU Gas. If the
callholder chooses to purchase the securities, TXU Gas may elect to have the
securities remarketed for a floating rate period of up to one year, in which
case the callholder must purchase the securities at the end of the floating
rate period. If the callholder exercises its right to call the securities on
October 15, 2002, or at the end of the floating rate period, the securities
will be remarketed at a fixed rate for a ten year period. If the callholder
does not purchase the securities on October 15, 2002, TXU Gas will be required
to redeem all of the securities for 100% of the aggregate principal amount
outstanding plus accrued interest.

   On December 20, 2000, TXU Electric issued $575 million aggregate principal
amount of Floating Rate First Mortgage Bonds due December 20, 2002 in two
series: $150 million in Series A and $425 million in Series B. The interest
rate on both series is based on LIBOR plus a margin and will be reset
quarterly. The initial rate on series A is 6.686% and on Series B is 7.286%.
On or after June 20, 2001, TXU Electric may redeem the securities, at its
option, on the 20th day of any calendar month prior to the maturity of these
securities, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of these
securities plus accrued and unpaid interest. TXU Electric's first mortgage
bonds are secured by a mortgage and deed of trust with a major financial
institution. Electric plant of TXU Electric is generally subject to the lien
of its mortgage.

   Europe -- At December 31, 2000, TXU Europe has a (Pounds)2.0 billion Euro
Medium Term Note (EMTN) program, under which TXU Europe may from time to time
issue notes in various currencies. On November 30, 2000, a financing
subsidiary of TXU Europe issued (Pounds)301 million ($450 million) of 35 Put 5
Resettable Notes due 2035 (Resettable Notes) under the EMTN program. The net
proceeds were used to pay down (Pounds)50 million of EMTN Notes due 2007 with
the remainder being held at year end December 31, 2000, to finance the
repayment of the rent factoring agreement in January 2001 and for other
corporate purposes. The initial interest rate on the Resettable Notes, up to
the first reset date of November 30, 2005, is 7.7875%. The issuer of the
Resettable Notes has a call option to repurchase the Resettable Notes at par
on November 30, 2005. This call option has been assigned to commercial banks
for a consideration of approximately (Pounds)5 million per annum for five
years. The Resettable Notes also include a put option that is exercisable at 5
years by the holder and a reset feature that permits the holder to remarket
the Resettable Notes at a different interest rate if the put is not exercised.
On the reset date, the new interest rate will be determined in accordance with
the terms of the Resettable Notes for the next 6 to 20 years. The Resettable
Notes can be redeemed at principal plus accrued interest on November 30, 2005.
As of December 31, 2000, there was also (Pounds)275 million ($411 million) in
7.25% Sterling Eurobonds due March 8, 2030 and (Pounds)100 million ($149
million) of 6.88% EMTN Notes due September 4, 2001 outstanding under the EMTN
program. Proceeds from these borrowings were used for a variety of corporate
purposes.

   On January 8, 2001, in connection with the financial closing of the
acquisition of Kiel AG, TXU Europe borrowed an additional (Euro)229 million
($219 million) at 5.54% per annum consisting of (Euro)47 million ($45 million)
under the sterling credit facility and (Euro)182 million ($174 million) under
the short-term 364-day facility (see note 4). An additional Norwegian kroner
(NOK) 50 million ($6 million) was borrowed under the sterling credit facility
on January 15, 2001.

   Australia -- In February 2000, TXU Australia restructured its senior bank
debt. The terms of all senior bank debt previously borrowed by TXU Australia
and TXU Australia Electricity were renegotiated and maturity dates extended,
so that all senior bank debt now ranks equally to senior debt of TXU
Australia.

   At December 31, 2000, TXU Australia had A$505 million ($283 million)
medium-term notes on which payments were issued under a policy issued by MBIA
Insurance Corporation. The medium-term notes have three tranches consisting of
fixed and variable rates due from October 2003 to September 2007. Proceeds for
the issuance were used to repay a syndicated loan facility and senior
acquisition facility.

   Sinking fund and maturity requirements for the years 2001 through 2005
under long-term debt instruments in effect at December 31, 2000, were as
follows:

   SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS, EACH HOLDING SOLELY JUNIOR SUBORDINATED
   DEBENTURES OF TXU CORP. OR RELATED SUBSIDIARY (TRUST SECURITIES)

   Statutory business trusts have been established as wholly-owned financing
subsidiaries (Trusts) of TXU Corp., TXU Electric and TXU Gas (parent
companies) for the purposes, in each case, of issuing trust securities and
holding Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by the Trust's parent company
(Debentures). TXU Corp. Capital I and II and TXU Electric Capital I and III
Trust Securities have a liquidation preference of $25 per unit, and TXU
Electric Capital IV and V and TXU Gas Capital I Trust Securities have a
liquidation preference of $1,000 per unit. The only assets of each Trust are
Debentures of its parent company having a principal amount set forth under
"Trust Assets" in the table below. The interest on Trust assets matches the
distributions on the Trust Securities. Each Trust uses interest payments
received on the Debentures it holds to make cash distributions on the Trust
Securities it has issued.

   The Trust Securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of
the Debentures at maturity or upon redemption. The Debentures are subject to
redemption, in whole or in part at the option of the parent company, at 100%
of their principal amount plus accrued interest, after an initial period
during which they may not be redeemed and at any time upon the occurrence of
certain events. The carrying value of the Trust Securities is increased
periodically to equal the redemption amounts at the mandatory redemption dates
with a corresponding increase in Trust Securities distributions.

   The statutory business trust subsidiaries of TXU Corp., TXU Electric and
TXU Gas had Trust Securities outstanding and Trust Assets as follows at
December 31:

   Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Perpetual Trust of TXU Europe -- In
March 2000, TXU Europe Capital I, a statutory business trust established as a
financing subsidiary for TXU Europe, issued to investors $150 million of 9
3/4% Trust Originated Preferred Securities (Preferred Trust Securities), in
6,000,000 units. The proceeds from this issuance were invested in Preferred
Partnership Securities issued by TXU Europe Funding I, L.P., a limited
partnership of which TXU Europe is the general partner. The Preferred Trust
Securities have a liquidation preference of $25 per unit. The only assets of
the trust are the Preferred Partnership Securities. The Trust has a perpetual
existence, subject to certain termination events as provided in its Amended
and Restated Trust Agreement. The Preferred Trust Securities are subject to
mandatory redemption upon payment of the Preferred Partnership Securities
which may be redeemed at the option of TXU Europe, in whole, or in part, at
any time on or after March 2, 2005. TXU Europe has issued certain limited
guarantees of the Preferred Trust Securities, the Preferred Partnership
Securities and the junior subordinated debentures held by TXU Europe Funding
I, L.P. The trust uses distributions it receives on the Preferred Partnership
Securities to make cash distributions on the Preferred Trust Securities.

8. Shareholders' Equity

    Common Stock Equity

   TXU Corp. has a Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(DRIP), an Employee's Thrift Plan of the Texas Utilities Company System
(Thrift Plan) and an Employee Stock Purchase and Savings Plan of ENSERCH
(EN$AVE). During the last three years, most of the requirements under the
DRIP, Thrift Plan and EN$AVE plans have been met through open market purchases
of TXU Corp.'s common stock. In 1998, approximately $8 million in common stock
of TXU Corp. was issued to the plans. No amounts of common stock were issued
to the plans in 2000 and 1999.

   At December 31, 2000, the Thrift Plan had an obligation of $247 million
outstanding in the form of a note, which TXU Corp. purchased from the original
third-party lender in April 1990 and recorded as a reduction to common equity.
At December 31, 2000, the Thrift Plan trustee held 4,654,625 shares of common
stock (LESOP Shares) of TXU Corp. valued at $44.31 per share, under the
leveraged employee stock ownership provision of the Thrift Plan. LESOP Shares
are held by the trustee until allocated to Thrift Plan participants when
required to meet TXU Corp.'s obligations under terms of the Thrift Plan. The
Thrift Plan uses dividends on the LESOP Shares held and contributions from TXU
Corp., if required, to repay interest and principal on the note. Common stock
equity increases at such time as LESOP Shares are allocated to participants'
accounts although shares of common stock outstanding include unallocated LESOP
Shares held by the trustee. Allocations to participants' accounts increased
common stock equity by $9 million in 2000 and $8 million in 1999 and 1998.

   The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan is a comprehensive, stock-based
incentive compensation plan, providing for discretionary awards (Awards) of
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares,
performance units, bonus stock and other stock-based awards. The maximum
number of shares of common stock for which Awards may be granted under the
plan is 2,500,000. During 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Board of Directors
authorized the award of 332,895, 208,200 and 68,000 shares, respectively, of
restricted common stock, which were issued subject to performance and vesting
requirements over a three- to five-year period.

   TXU Europe offers a Long-Term Incentive Plan, a Sharesave and a Loyalty
Award Plan to eligible UK-based employees. TXU Corp. applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for
its employee share plans. TXU Corp.'s compensation costs recorded for these
plans were $12 million, $15 million and $3 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Had compensation costs been determined based on SFAS No. 123,
there would have been no significant difference in the compensation expense
recognized.


                                     B-49
<PAGE>

   Effective with the merger of TXU Gas with TXU Corp., outstanding options
for TXU Gas common stock were exchanged for options for 532,913 shares of TXU
Corp.'s common stock exercisable at prices ranging from $7.03 to $37.71 per
share, and TXU Gas was precluded from awarding further options. The estimated
fair value of these options of $3.2 million was accounted for as a part of the
cost of the acquisition. At December 31, 2000, 199,370 of these options
remained outstanding and exercisable.

   At December 31, 2000, 30,252,783 shares of the authorized but unissued
common stock of TXU Corp. were reserved for issuance and sale pursuant to the
above plans, for equity-linked securities and for other purposes.

   During 2000, TXU Corp. repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares of its
common stock for $596 million. The cost of the repurchased shares, to the
extent it exceeded the average contributed capital per share, has been charged
to retained earnings.

   At December 31, 2000, TXU Corp. had two equity purchase agreements with
separate financial institutions to purchase shares of TXU Corp.'s common
stock. The timing and amount of these purchases are made at the direction of
management. The repurchase price is the weighted average price per share the
financial institutions paid plus commissions and interest less dividends. The
contracts are recorded in temporary equity at the maximum cash settlement
amount required to physically settle the contracts. TXU Corp. expects to
unwind these contracts in 2001, which would have no effect on earnings.

   Preference Stock -- On June 15, 2000, TXU Corp. issued 3,000 shares of
Series B preference stock for $300 million. The preference stock has a
dividend rate of 7.24% until June 15, 2005. The dividend rate for subsequent
periods will be determined according to periodic auctions. The Series B
preference stock has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share. TXU Corp.
may not redeem the shares before June 15, 2005. TXU Corp. is authorized to
issue up to 50 million shares of preference stock in one or more series.

   In connection with the Pinnacle Transactions, TXU Corp. issued 810,000
shares of its Mandatorily Convertible Single Reset Preference Stock, Series C
(Series C Preference Stock) to Pinnacle One Share Trust, a consolidated trust
(Share Trust). The Series C Preference Stock has a liquidation preference of
$1,000 per share. In certain circumstances, the Share Trust could be required
to sell some or all of the Series C Preference Stock or TXU Corp. could be
required to issue new common stock to the Share Trust which the Share Trust
could be required to sell. The proceeds of these sales, or remarketings, would
be used to repay obligations of Pinnacle. Remarketing of the Series C
Preference Stock or any new TXU Corp. common stock issued to the Share Trust
could occur in the event of a default by Pinnacle in connection with its
senior notes or a significant market decline in TXU Corp.'s common stock
coupled with a decline in the credit ratings for TXU Corp.'s unsecured, senior
long-term obligations. The Series C Preference Stock held by the Share Trust
does not currently accrue dividends. In the event there is a remarketing of
the Series C Preference Stock, the dividend rate and conversion rate will be
reset based on the current yield and market price of TXU Corp.'s common stock
at the time of remarketing.

   Shareholders Rights Plan -- In February 1999, the Board of Directors
adopted a shareholder rights plan pursuant to which shareholders were granted
rights to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preference Stock
(Rights) for each share of TXU Corp.'s common stock held.

   In the event that any person acquires more than 15% of TXU Corp.'s
outstanding common stock, the Rights become exercisable, entitling each holder
(other than the acquiring person or group) to purchase that number of shares
of securities or other property of TXU Corp. having a market value equal to
two times the exercise price of the Rights. If TXU Corp. were acquired in a
merger or other

                                     B-50
<PAGE>

business combination, each Right would entitle its holder to purchase a number
of the acquiring company's common shares having a market value of two times
the exercise price of the Right. In either case, TXU Corp.'s Board of
Directors may choose to redeem the Rights before they become exercisable. TXU
Corp.'s Board declared a dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of
Common Stock. Rights were distributed to shareholders of record on March 1,
1999.

   At December 31, 2000, TXU Corp. had $608 million of alternative minimum tax
credit carryforwards available to offset future tax payments. At December 31,
2000, TXU Gas had pre-merger net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $277
million that begin to expire in 2003. The NOL's can be used to offset future
taxable income of TXU Corp. Due to a 1999 change in Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) regulations, TXU Corp. fully expects to utilize all such NOL's prior to
their expiration date. Accordingly, a $10 million deferred tax asset valuation
allowance recorded in 1998 was reversed in 1999. TXU Corp. utilized $42
million of NOL's in 2000. At December 31, 2000, TXU Australia had

                                     B-52
<PAGE>

$392 million and TXU Europe had $115 million of tax loss carryforwards that
can be used to offset future taxable income in their respective jurisdictions.
Such tax loss carryforwards do not have expiration dates. TXU Europe has
recorded a valuation allowance of $239 million against the deferred tax assets
related to leased assets.

   TXU Corp.'s income tax returns are subject to audit by applicable tax
authorities. In management's opinion, an adequate provision has been made for
any future taxes that may be owed as a result of any audits. To the extent
that adjustments to income tax accounts of acquired businesses for periods
prior to their acquisition are required as a result of an audit, the
adjustment will be added to or deducted from goodwill.

10.RETIREMENT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

   Most US employees are covered by various defined benefit pension plans
which provide benefits based on years of service and average earnings. In
addition, most US employees are eligible for voluntary participation in either
the Thrift Plan or EN$AVE. The plans are participant-directed defined
contribution combination employee stock ownership and profit sharing plans
under Section 401(k) and 401(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and are subject
to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Under each of the plans, a participant may invest, through pre-tax salary
deferrals or after-tax payroll deductions, a specified amount ranging from 1%
to 16% of regular salary or wages. Employer matching contributions as a
percentage of participant contributions, up to 6% of base pay, are at a rate
of 40%, 50% or 60% depending on length of service. Contributions to the Thrift
Plan and EN$AVE aggregated $15 million for 2000, 1999 and 1998.

   During 1999, certain US employees were offered and accepted early
retirement and settlement options resulting in curtailment losses and
settlement gains. As a portion of these costs are recoverable, an offsetting
regulatory asset was recorded. Effects of the early retirement options
applicable to regulated business were recorded as regulatory assets.

   TXU Europe participates in several defined benefit pension plans in the UK
which cover the majority of its employees. The benefits under these plans are
primarily based on years of credited service and final average compensation
levels as defined under the respective plan provisions. In the UK, the
majority of TXU Europe employees are members of the Electricity Supply Pension
Scheme (ESPS) which provides pensions of a defined benefit nature for
employees throughout the electricity supply industry. The ESPS operates on the
basis that there is no cross-subsidy between employers and the funding of TXU
Europe's pension liabilities is, therefore, independent of the experience of
other participating employers. The assets of the ESPS are held in a separate
trustee-administered fund and consist principally of UK and European equities,
UK property holdings and cash. The pension cost relating to the TXU Europe
portion of the ESPS is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent
qualified actuaries using the projected unit method. The benefits under these
plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation levels as
defined under the respective plan provisions.

   TXU Australia sponsors various pension plans covering the majority of its
employees. TXU Australia's contributions to its defined contribution plans
were A$2.0 million ($1.1 million), A$1.8 million ($1.2 million) and A$1.2
million ($0.7 million) for 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

   The pension information presented below has been adjusted to reflect the
impact of the following events in the UK during 2000: the sale of the metering
business (May 2000), the acquisition of Norweb Energi (August 2000) and the
related transfer of customer services personnel to Vertex (September 2000). As
a result of these events there has been a significant movement of employees
out of and into the pension scheme. The net effect of these curtailments and
settlements was a loss of less than (Pounds)1 million ($1.5 million) for 2000.


                                     B-53

   The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for the
pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$111 million and $77 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2000 and $31
million and $7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 1999.

   The expected increase in costs of future benefits covered by the
postretirement benefit plans is projected using a health care cost trend rate
of 5% in 2001 and thereafter. A one percentage point increase in the assumed
health care cost trend rate in each future year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2000 by approximately $76
million and other postretirement benefits cost for 2000 by approximately $9.2
million.

11.DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

   TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments, including
options, swaps, futures, forwards and other contractual commitments for both
non-trading and trading purposes. TXU Corp. and its domestic and international
subsidiaries enter into derivative instruments for non-trading purposes in
order to manage market risks related to changes in interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Gains and losses on non-trading
derivative instruments effective as hedges are deferred and recorded as a
component of the underlying transaction when settled. TXU Corp. also enters
into derivative instruments and other contractual commitments for trading
purposes through its subsidiaries TXU Energy Trading, TXU Europe Energy
Trading and TXU Australia. Contracts entered into for trading purposes are
recorded on a mark-to-market basis with gains and losses recognized in
earnings in the period in which such valuation changes occur.

Non-Trading

   Interest Rate Risk Management -- TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries enter into
interest rate swaps to manage exposures to the market risk inherent in fixed
rate debt securities and the cash flow risk inherent in variable rate
securities. The terms of each swap and the underlying hedged security are in
Notes 5 and 6.

   Foreign Currency Risk Management -- TXU Corp. has exposure to foreign
currency risks, primarily with the pound sterling and the Australian dollar.
TXU Europe and TXU Australia have accessed the US capital markets and issued
dollar denominated obligations. TXU Corp. and its subsidiaries enter into
currency swaps, options and forwards, where appropriate, to manage foreign
currency exposures.

   TXU Europe has entered into currency arrangements with respect to the
principal and semi-annual interest payments on $500 million of bonds to swap
from dollars to pounds sterling. For the principal payments, TXU Europe
entered into a forward foreign currency contract to acquire $200 million and
$300 million in October 2017 and October 2027, respectively, for approximately
(Pounds)218 million ($352 million). The difference between the forward rate
and spot rate at inception of the contract (a foreign currency gain of
approximately (Pounds)92 million) is being amortized to income over the life
of the contract. For interest payments on the $200 million 7.425% notes due
2017 and the $300 million 7.55% notes due 2027, the contract sets the exchange
rate between pounds sterling and dollars at $1.605 and $1.6245, respectively.

   TXU Europe has entered into currency swaps that fix the principal amount
and interest payments on $1.5 billion of Senior Notes to be repaid in pounds
sterling at a weighted-average exchange rate between pounds sterling and US
dollars at $1.629.

   TXU Australia maintains cross currency swaps for its US dollar denominated
debt. These swaps mature in December 2006 and December 2016 for $250 million
and $100 million, respectively. The maturity of these swaps coincides with the
maturity of the US dollar denominated debt.

   Energy Price Risk Management -- In the UK and Australia, electricity prices
are established through power pools which are controlled through an agreement
with the licensed generators and suppliers in the case of the UK, or by a
statutory, independent corporation in the case of Australia. In both cases,
substantially all power must be sold into and purchased from the pools. In
order to manage the exposure to fluctuations in electricity pool prices, TXU
Europe and TXU Australia enter into both short- and long-term derivative
instruments whereby the pool price is fixed for an agreed-upon quantity and
duration by reference to an agreed-upon strike price. In the US, as a result
of continued regulation, TXU Electric and TXU Gas have minimal exposure to
energy price risk, therefore, their use of derivative instruments is limited.

   The fair values of outstanding contracts for differences (CfDs),
electricity forward agreements (EFAs) and other contracts held for non-trading
purposes at December 31, 2000 were out-of-the-money (negative) (Pounds)589
million ($880 million) compared with in-the-money fair values (positive) of

                                     B-56
<PAGE>

(Pounds)76 million ($123 million) at December 31, 1999. These values were
calculated as the difference between the expected value of the CfDs, EFAs and
other contracts and the current market value, based on an estimate of forward
prices for the term of the CfD, EFA or other contract. The decrease in fair
values from 1999 primarily reflects a decline in UK pool prices and a
lengthening of the portfolio position. At December 31, 2000, the outstanding
notional quantity of all electricity commodity instruments under contracts
held for non-trading purposes was 358 TWh of electricity for periods to 2018.
The market for the CfDs and EFAs has not been liquid to date, and there is no
readily identifiable market through which the majority of CfDs or EFAs could
be realized through an exchange.

   TXU Australia has entered into wholesale market contracts for most of its
contestable load through the end of 2001. At December 31, 2000, these
contracts cover a notional volume of approximately 0.4 million MWh.

Trading

   TXU Corp. has continued to position itself to provide comprehensive energy
products and services to a diversified client base in the US, Europe and
Australia. In the US, TXU Energy Trading continues to engage in risk
management activities, including the purchase and sale of physical
commodities, and entering into futures contracts, other forward commitments,
swap agreements, exchange traded options, over-the-counter options which are
net settled or physically settled, exchange-of-futures-for physical
transactions, energy exchange transactions, storage activities, and other
contractual arrangements. TXU Europe and TXU Australia offer price risk
management services to customers through a variety of financial and other
instruments including contracts for differences (swaps), virtual power
stations, written options and forward contracts.

   The trading subsidiaries all manage the market risk on a portfolio basis
within limitations imposed by their respective Boards of Directors and in
accordance with TXU Corp.'s overall risk management policies. Market risks are
monitored daily, utilizing appropriate mark-to-market methodologies, which
value the portfolio of contracts and the hypothetical effect on this value
from changes in market conditions. Each entity uses various techniques and
methodologies that simulate forward price curves in their respective markets
to estimate the size and probability of changes in market value resulting from
price movements. These techniques include, but are not limited to, sensitivity
analyses. The use of these methodologies requires a number of key assumptions
including the selection of confidence levels, the holding period of the
positions, and the depth and applicability to future periods of historical
price information.

   The portfolio subjects the entities to a number of risks and costs
associated with the future contractual commitments, including price risk,
credit risk associated with counterparties, product location (basis)
differentials and market liquidity. Each entity continuously monitors the
valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio valuation based on
present market conditions. Reserves are established in recognition that
certain risks exist until delivery of energy has occurred, counterparties have
fulfilled their financial commitments and related financial instruments mature
or are closed out. Price and credit risk are further managed through the
established trading policies and limits for each trading entity which are
evaluated on a daily basis.

   US -- The exposure of fixed price natural gas and electric power purchase
and sale commitments, and derivative financial instruments, including options,
swaps, futures and other contractual commitments, is based on a methodology
that uses a five-day holding period and a 95% confidence level. The notional
amounts and terms of the portfolio as of December 31, 2000 included financial
instruments that provide for fixed price receipts of 1,589 trillion British
thermal units equivalent (Tbtue) and fixed price payments of 2,664 Tbtue, with
a maximum term of seven years. Additionally, sales and purchase commitments
totaling 1,273 Tbtue, with terms extending up to seven years, are included in
the portfolio as of December 31, 2000.

   Europe -- At December 31, 2000, the outstanding notional quantity of
commodity instruments under contracts held for trading purposes, on a net
buy/sell basis, was 29 TWh of electricity for periods to 2005 and 1,589
million Therms (0.2 Bcf) of gas for periods to 2006.

   Australia -- In May 1999, TXU Australia entered into a twenty year option
agreement with AES Ecogen which owns 966MW of gas-fired generation facilities
that are typically used during peak periods of demand for electricity in
Victoria. The agreement provides TXU Australia with the ability to enter into
contracts with AES Ecogen, at TXU Australia's option, which would require an
exchange of cash for the difference between the amounts specified in the
contracts and the spot price of electricity. TXU Australia made an initial
option premium payment of $A201 million ($131 million) and is required to make
further future monthly payments over the term of the agreement. The option is
marked to market and had a fair value of $A237 million ($133 million) at
December 31, 2000.

   Prior to acquisition, Optima had entered into various contracts with third
parties. These contracts call for difference payments between the contracted
price and the pool price, and do not involve an obligation to supply power. At
December 31, 2000, the carrying value of the liability was $A99 million ($55
million) (out of the money). The sale commitments under the contracts amounted
to 2.1 million MWh as of December 31, 2000, with terms extending to December
31, 2002.

   TXU Australia offers price risk management services to customers through a
variety of financial and other instruments, including swaps, options, caps and
swaptions. TXU Australia's sale and purchase commitments for trading purposes
amounting to 7.1 million MWh and 6.4 million MWh, respectively, with terms
extending up to 2002, are included in the electricity portfolio as of
December 31, 2000. The fair value of contracts was A$15 million ($8 million)
at December 31, 2000.

   The following table displays the mark-to-market values of the energy
trading risk management assets and liabilities:

   TXU Corp. recorded net trading losses of $7 million at TXU Energy Trading
in 2000 and net trading gains of $152 million and $36 million at TXU Europe
and TXU Australia, respectively, in 2000. In 1999, TXU Corp. recorded net
trading gains of $9 million, $38 million, and $2 million at TXU Energy
Trading, TXU Europe and TXU Australia, respectively.

   Credit Risk -- Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that TXU Corp. would
incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties. TXU Corp. maintains
credit policies with regard to its counterparties that enable management to
manage overall credit risk. TXU Corp. generally does not obtain collateral to
support the agreements but establishes credit limits, monitors the financial
viability of counterparties and seeks guarantees when appropriate. In the
event a counterparty's credit rating declines, TXU Corp. may apply certain
remedies, if considered necessary. TXU Corp. believes that it has established
adequate reserves in regard to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties.

</TABLE>

  *Excludes capital leases.

   The fair values of long-term debt and preferred stock subject to mandatory
redemption are estimated at the lesser of either the call price or the market
value as determined by quoted market prices, where available, or, where not
available, at the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates
consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risk. The fair value
of trust securities is based on quoted market prices. The carrying amounts for
financial assets classified as current assets and the carrying amounts for
financial liabilities classified as current liabilities approximate fair value
due to the short maturity of such instruments.

   Other investments, primarily include deposits in an external trust fund for
nuclear decommissioning of Comanche Peak, which is carried at market value,
and restricted cash held as collateral for certain leases, for which the
carrying value approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of these
instruments. The trust fund is invested primarily in fixed income debt and
equity securities, which are considered as available-for-sale. Any unrealized
gains or losses are treated as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities,
respectively.

   Common stock has been reduced by the note receivable from the trustee of
the leveraged employee stock ownership provision of the Thrift Plan. The fair
value of such note is estimated at the lesser of TXU Corp.'s call price or the
present value of future cash flows discounted at rates consistent with
comparable maturities adjusted for credit risk.

   The fair value of the financial guarantees has been determined using the
full notional amount of the guarantees. Fair values for off-balance sheet
instruments (interest rate and currency swaps) are based either on quotes or
the cost to terminate the agreements. The fair values of contracts for
differences, electricity forward agreements and other energy contracts are
based upon a discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of energy forward
prices. The fair value amount shown for non-trading contracts is the excess of
fair value over the provisions for unfavorable contracts that are recorded as
liabilities. The fair values of other financial instruments for which carrying
amounts and fair values have not been presented are not materially different
than their related carrying amounts.

13. REGULATION AND RATES

   US -- Docket No. 21527 -- In October 1999, TXU Electric filed a petition
with the PUC for a financing order (Docket No. 21527) to permit the issuance
by a special purpose entity of $1.65 billion of transition bonds secured by
payments designed to enable TXU Electric to recover its generation-related
regulatory assets and other qualified costs in accordance with the 1999
Restructuring Legislation. The proceeds received by TXU Electric from the
issuance of the transition bonds are to be used solely for the purpose of
retiring utility debt and equity. On May 1, 2000, the PUC signed a final order
rejecting TXU Electric's request for the $1.65 billion and authorized only
$363 million. TXU Electric filed an appeal on May 2, 2000 with the Travis
County, Texas District Court.

   On September 7, 2000, the Travis County, Texas District Court issued a
final judgment reversing that part of the PUC's financing order that utilized
regulated asset life (up to 40 years) for purposes of present-valuing the
benefits of securitization. Instead, the District Court ruled that a present-
value period based upon stranded cost and regulatory asset recovery periods
authorized under the 1999 Restructuring Legislation should have been used by
the PUC. The District Court also ruled that the PUC statements in its
financing order concerning the future impact of securitization of loss on
reacquired debt were only an advisory opinion. The judgment affirmed other
aspects of the PUC's financing order and ordered the case remanded to the PUC
for further proceedings consistent with the judgment. TXU Electric and various
other parties have appealed this judgment directly to the Texas Supreme Court.
TXU Electric expects that any difference between the $1.65 billion and the
amount finally authorized will continue to be deferred until recovery of
generation-related regulatory assets is addressed again by the PUC. TXU
Electric is unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings.

   As noted above, the principal and interest on the transition bonds will be
secured by payments from retail customers designed to enable TXU Electric to
recover its generation-related regulatory assets and other qualified costs.
These regulatory assets have a carrying value of $1.86 billion. Once
transition bonds are issued, the full amount of the regulatory assets will be
amortized to expense over the life of the transition bonds. Distribution rates
will increase to reflect these payments. Consolidated revenues of TXU Corp.
will not necessarily increase, however, during 2001 and the "price to beat"
period. If these payments from retail customers commence in 2001, they will be
excluded from revenue for purposes of determining whether earnings have
exceeded the earnings cap. There is no earnings cap after 2001.

   The constitutionality of the securitization provisions of the 1999
Restructuring Legislation under the Texas constitution has been challenged in
connection with a securitization request made by Central Power and Light
Company. In July 2000, the Travis County, Texas District Court issued its
judgment denying this appeal and finding that the securitization provisions
are constitutional. This judgment has been appealed directly to the Texas
Supreme Court. TXU Electric is unable to predict the outcome of such
proceedings.

   From January 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, earnings in excess of TXU
Electric's earnings cap were recorded as additional depreciation of nuclear
production assets. Effective July 1, 1999, following the 1999 Restructuring
Legislation, earnings in excess of the earnings cap were recorded as a
reduction of revenues, with a corresponding regulatory liability recorded.
Additionally, from January 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, depreciation expense
was reclassified from T&D to nuclear production assets. Effective July 1,
1999, following the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, T&D depreciation expense
was no longer transferred to nuclear production assets; instead an amount
equivalent to T&D depreciation was recorded as a regulatory asset, with a
corresponding amount recorded as a regulatory liability. The regulatory asset
will be amortized as it is recovered through the distribution portion of the
business, while the regulatory liability will be applied against stranded
generation assets.

   Docket No. 22350 -- As required by the 1999 Restructuring Legislation, in
January 2000, TXU Electric filed its business separation plan with the PUC. In
March 2000, TXU Electric filed its

                                     B-60
<PAGE>

application for approval of its unbundled cost of service rates with the PUC.
This plan and application lay the foundation for retail competition to begin
in the Texas electricity market. Under the business separation plan, the
generation business unit and the retail business unit of TXU Electric will
become unregulated entities and will be allowed to compete for customers. The
T&D business units of TXU Electric will be separated into regulated entities
and will together represent the regulated part of the business. In addition to
the actual T&D charges for delivering electricity, these rates include nuclear
decommissioning fund charges, system benefit fund charges and stranded cost
recovery charges. In the March 2000 filing, TXU Electric's stranded costs were
estimated to be approximately $3.7 billion, including the regulatory assets
that were part of the Docket No. 21527 proceedings and amounts related to the
remand of Docket No. 9300, addressed below. TXU Electric filed an updated
stranded cost estimate on August 28, 2000 to reflect various PUC decisions
made since Docket No. 22350 was filed. In the August 28, 2000 filing, TXU
Electric's stranded costs were estimated to be $2.8 billion. Subsequent to the
August 2000 filing, the PUC has required TXU Electric to revise the stranded
cost estimate to remove amounts related to regulatory assets, certain
environmental expenditures, and the remand of Docket No. 9300, which resulted
in a revised estimate of $14 million, including displaced worker costs. TXU
Electric has appealed certain of the PUC's decisions related to this matter to
the Travis County, Texas District Court. Various parties to Docket No. 22350
have presented stranded cost estimates ranging from negative $1.5 billion to
negative $3.5 billion along with recommendations that these amounts be
returned to customers beginning in 2002. The estimate established in Docket
No. 22350 is subject to a future market-based "true-up" in 2004. TXU Electric
is unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings.

   Docket No. 9300/Docket No. 22652 -- The PUC's final order (Order) in
connection with TXU Electric's January 1990 rate increase request (Docket No.
9300) was ultimately reviewed by the Texas Supreme Court. As a result, an
aggregate of $909 million of disallowances with respect to TXU Electric's
reacquisitions of minority owners' interests in Comanche Peak, which had
previously been recorded as a charge to TXU Electric's earnings, was remanded
to the District Court with instructions that it be remanded to the PUC for
reconsideration on the basis of a prudent investment standard. On remand, the
PUC also was required to reevaluate the appropriate level of TXU Electric's
construction work in progress included in rate base in light of its financial
condition at the time of the initial hearing. In connection with the
settlement of Docket No. 18490, proceedings in the remand of Docket No. 9300
had been stayed through December 31, 1999. In April 2000, TXU Electric
requested that the District Court enter an order remanding Docket No. 9300 to
the PUC. On June 9, 2000, the District Court's order of remand was filed with
the PUC, and the PUC has assigned the remand proceeding Docket No. 22652.
Pursuant to an order entered on August 31, 2000, this docket will be held in
abeyance until March 20, 2001. TXU Electric cannot predict the outcome of the
reconsideration of the Order on remand by the PUC.

   Docket No. 22344 -- In a generic issues docket held in August 2000, the PUC
issued orders that impacted TXU Electric's recovery of restructuring expenses
and certain other regulatory assets. Accordingly, in September 2000, such
unrecovered regulatory assets totaling $52 million were written off. This
reduced earnings in excess of the regulatory earnings cap by an equal amount.
As a result, there was no impact to net income.

   Fuel Cost Recovery Rule -- Pursuant to a PUC rule, the recovery of TXU
Electric's eligible fuel costs is provided through fixed fuel factors. The
rule allows a utility's fuel factor to be revised upward or downward every six
months, according to a specified schedule. A utility is required to petition
to make either surcharges or refunds to ratepayers, together with interest
based on a twelve-month average of prime commercial rates, for any material
cumulative under- or over-recovery of fuel costs. If the cumulative difference
of the under- or over-recovery, plus interest, exceeds 4% of the annual
estimated fuel costs most recently approved by the PUC, it will be deemed to
be material.

                                     B-61
<PAGE>

   Final reconciliation of fuel costs must be made either in a reconciliation
proceeding or in a general rate case. In a final reconciliation, a utility has
the burden of proving that fuel costs under review were reasonable and
necessary to provide reliable electric service, that it has properly accounted
for its fuel-related revenues, and that fuel prices charged to the utility by
an affiliate were reasonable and necessary and not higher than prices charged
for similar items by such affiliate to other affiliates or nonaffiliates. For
generating utilities like TXU Electric, through August 31, 1999, the rule
provided for recovery of purchased power capacity costs through a power cost
recovery factor with respect to purchases from qualifying facilities, to the
extent such costs were not otherwise included in base rates. Pursuant to the
1999 Restructuring Legislation, the power cost recovery factor will be frozen
between September 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. The energy-related costs of
such purchases continue to be included in the fixed fuel factor. TXU Electric
is required to file in 2002 with the PUC for final reconciliation of its
eligible fuel costs. This final reconciliation will cover the period July 1998
through December 2001.

   Docket No. 22880/Docket No. 23153 -- Because natural gas prices recently
have exceeded those in the base fuel factor, on August 4, 2000, TXU Electric
filed a request with the PUC in Docket No. 22880 to surcharge the cumulative
under-collection of fuel cost revenues that existed as of June 30, 2000,
together with interest through November 2000, in the amount of $167 million,
and to increase its current fuel factors by 27.6%. On August 31, 2000, the
Administrative Law Judge entered an Interim Order, implementing an agreement
of the parties, providing for an interim increase in fuel factors of 13.8%,
effective September 6, 2000, and a surcharge of TXU Electric's cumulative
under-recovery of fuel cost revenues that existed as of July 31, 2000,
together with the interest through November 2000, in the amount of $315
million to be collected over the fourteen-month period beginning November
2000. On October 13, 2000, TXU Electric filed a Supplemental Application with
the PUC requesting its initial 27.6% fuel factor increase instead of the
interim increase. Also on October 13, 2000, TXU Electric filed a request with
the PUC in Docket No. 23153 for a surcharge to recover a $231 million under-
collection of fuel cost revenues for the months of August and September 2000.
The proposed surcharge would be collected from January 2001 through December
2001. Docket No. 23153 was subsequently consolidated into Docket No. 22880. On
January 11, 2001, the PUC approved TXU Electric's requests in Docket No. 22880
and Docket No. 23153. Also on January 11, 2001, the PUC approved the requested
fuel factor increase, effective that date. The PUC also approved the surcharge
request filed in Docket No. 23153, effective January 11, 2001 through December
31, 2001.

   Docket No. 23640 -- In February 2001, TXU Electric filed with the PUC a
request for a surcharge to recover under-collected fuel cost revenues for the
months of October 2000 through December 2000, plus estimated under-recoveries
for the period January 2001 through March 2001 totaling $591 million, and to
increase its current fuel factor by 26.4% over the increase in Docket No.
22880. The proposed fuel factor increase would be effective March 5, 2001 and
the proposed surcharge would be collected from April 2001 through December
2001. TXU Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

   Clean Air Act -- The Federal Clean Air Act, as amended (Clean Air Act)
includes provisions which, among other things, place limits on SO\\2\\ and NOx
emissions produced by generating units. TXU Electric's capital requirements
have not been significantly affected by the requirements of the Clean Air Act.

   Purchased Power Contracts -- TXU Electric and SESCO have entered into
contracts to purchase power through the year 2005. These contracts provide for
capacity payments subject to performance standards and energy payments based
on the actual power taken under contract. Capacity payments under these
contracts for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $194
million, $235 million and $247 million, respectively.

                                     B-62
<PAGE>

   Assuming operating standards are achieved, future capacity payments under
US Electric segment agreements are estimated as follows:

</TABLE>

   Capacity payments and guarantee -- TXU Europe Energy Trading has several
contracts requiring the payment of annual capacity fees. Under the terms of
these contracts, TXU Europe Energy Trading will pay (subject to contract
terms) an annual capacity fee of (Pounds)318 million ($475 million) in 2001,
(Pounds)346 million ($517 million) in 2002, (Pounds)373 million ($557 million)
in 2003, (Pounds)389 million ($581 million) in 2004, (Pounds)389 million ($581
million) in 2005 and (Pounds)3,220 million ($4,809 million) thereafter. In
addition, TXU Europe will provide a (Pounds)300 million ($448 million)
guarantee (declining over time) representing approximately one year's capacity
payment, with the counterparty providing a (Pounds)170 million ($254 million)
guarantee.

   Coal Contracts -- TXU Europe has two coal purchase agreements with a
supplier. The first agreement is for 21 million tons in total through 2003.
The second agreement is also for 21 million tons in total between 2003 and
2009. Total committed purchases under these contracts were approximately
(Pounds)1.4 billion ($2.1 billion) at December 31, 2000.

   Coal Transportation Contracts -- TXU Electric supplements its lignite fuel
with western coal. The coal is transported to TXU Electric's generating plants
under three contracts. The annual commitment under these contracts is $53
million for the year 2001, $34 million for the years 2002 and 2003 and $17
million thereafter.

   US Gas Purchase Contracts -- TXU Fuel Company and TXU Gas Distribution buy
gas under long-term and short-term intrastate contracts in order to assure
reliable supply to their customers. Many of these contracts require minimum
purchases ("take-or-pay") of gas. TXU Gas Distribution has made accruals for
payments that may be required for settlement of gas-purchase contract claims
asserted or that are probable of assertion. TXU Gas Distribution continually
evaluates its position relative to asserted and unasserted claims, above-
market prices or future commitments. Based on estimated gas demand, which
assumes normal weather conditions, requisite gas purchases of TXU Fuel, TXU
Gas Distribution and TXU Europe are expected to substantially satisfy their
purchase obligations for 2000 and thereafter.

   Europe Gas Take-or-Pay Contracts -- TXU Europe is party to various types of
contracts for the purchase of gas. Almost all include take-or-pay obligations
under which the buyer agrees to pay for a minimum quantity of gas in a year.
In order to help meet the expected needs of its wholesale and retail
customers, TXU Europe Limited has entered into a range of gas purchase
contracts. At December 31, 2000 the commitments under long-term gas purchase
contracts amounted to an estimated (Pounds)633 million ($945 million) covering
periods up to 16 years forward. Management does not consider it likely, on the
basis of TXU Europe's current expectations of demand from its customers that
any material payments will become due for gas not taken.

   Australia Gas Take-or-Pay Contracts -- TXU Australia is party to various
types of contracts for the purchase of gas. These include take-or-pay
obligations under which the buyer agrees to pay for a minimum quantity of gas
in a year. At December 31, 2000, TXU Australia had commitments under

                                     B-63
<PAGE>

long-term gas purchase contracts estimated at A$1.2 million ($672 million)
through 2010. On the basis of TXU Australia's current expectations of demand
from its customers as compared with its take-or-pay obligations under such
purchase contracts, management does not consider it likely that any material
payments will become due from TXU Australia for gas not taken.

   Leases -- Subsidiaries have entered into operating leases covering various
facilities and properties including generating plants, combustion turbines,
transportation, mining equipment, data processing equipment and office space.
Certain of these leases contain renewal and purchase options and residual
value guarantee. Lease costs charged to operating expense for 2000, 1999 and
1998 were $192 million, $212 million and $243 million, respectively.

   Future minimum lease payments under capital leases, together with the
present value of such minimum lease payments, and future minimum lease
commitments under operating leases that have initial or remaining
noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2000, were
as follows:

</TABLE>

   Substantially all of the capital lease obligations relate to coal-fired
power stations in the UK. Additional payments of approximately (Pounds)6 per
megawatt hour (indexed from 1996 prices) linked to output levels from the
stations were payable (under the original lease terms) for the first seven
years of their operations by TXU Europe (operations commenced in 1996). In
accounting for the acquisition of TEG, a liability for the estimated probable
additional payments linked to output levels for coal-fired generating stations
was established. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the balance of the liability
of (Pounds)196 million ($293 million) and (Pounds)291 million ($471 million),
respectively, is included with capital lease obligations. TXU Europe exercised
the option to purchase the land in January 2001. At this time, remaining
outstanding fixed lease payments became financial obligations to a third party
and will be settled during 2001. The National Power leases have been accounted
for as capital leases.

   In May 2000, TXU Australia acquired certain assets and liabilities of
Optima. The acquisition included a 100-year capital lease to operate the
Torrens Island power station. TXU Australia has no future obligations under
the lease, as the lease payments were fully prepaid at the inception of the
lease. The capital lease contains a bargain purchase option. The leased
generating assets are amortized over the shorter of the lease term and the
useful life of the assets. As at the acquisition date of May 4, 2000, the
remaining useful life of the assets is 30 years.

   Financial Guarantees -- TXU Electric has entered into contracts with public
agencies to purchase cooling water for use in the generation of electric
energy and has agreed, in effect, to guarantee the principal, $22 million at
December 31, 2000, and interest on bonds issued to finance the reservoirs from
which the water is supplied. The bonds mature at various dates through 2011
and have interest rates ranging from 5 1/2% to 7%. TXU Electric is required to
make periodic payments equal to such

                                     B-64
<PAGE>

principal and interest, including amounts assumed by a third party and
reimbursed to TXU Electric, of $4 million annually for the years 2001 through
2003, $7 million for 2004 and $1 million for 2005. Annual payments made by TXU
Electric, net of amounts assumed by a third party under such contracts, for
1998, 1999 and 2000 were $4 million each year. In addition, TXU Electric is
obligated to pay certain variable costs of operating and maintaining the
reservoirs. TXU Electric has assigned to a municipality all contract rights
and obligations of TXU Electric in connection with $42 million remaining
principal amount of bonds at December 31, 2000, issued for similar purposes
which had previously been guaranteed by TXU Electric. TXU Electric is,
however, contingently liable in the unlikely event of default by the
municipality.

   TXU Europe has guaranteed up to (Pounds)74 million ($110 million) at
December 31, 2000 of certain liabilities that may be incurred and payable by
the purchasers of TEG's US and Australian coal business and US energy
marketing operations sold in 1998 prior to acquisition by TXU Corp. These
guarantees are with respect to the Peabody Holding Company Retirement Plan for
Salaried Employees, the Powder River Coal Company Retirement Plan and the
Peabody Coal UMWA Retirement Plan, subject to certain specified conditions.

   Nuclear Insurance -- With regard to liability coverage, the Price-Anderson
Act (Act) provides financial protection for the public in the event of a
significant nuclear power plant incident. The Act sets the statutory limit of
public liability for a single nuclear incident currently at $9.5 billion and
requires nuclear power plant operators to provide financial protection for
this amount. As required, TXU Electric provides this financial protection for
a nuclear incident at Comanche Peak resulting in public bodily injury and
property damage through a combination of private insurance and industry-wide
retrospective payment plans. As the first layer of financial protection, TXU
Electric has purchased $200 million of liability insurance from American
Nuclear Insurers (ANI), which provides such insurance on behalf of a major
stock insurance company pool, Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association.
The second layer of financial protection is provided under an industry-wide
retrospective payment program called Secondary Financial Protection (SFP).

   Under the SFP, each operating licensed reactor in the US is subject to an
assessment of up to $88 million, subject to increases for inflation every five
years, in the event of a nuclear incident at any nuclear plant in the US.
Assessments are limited to $10 million per operating licensed reactor per year
per incident. All assessments under the SFP are subject to a 3% insurance
premium tax which is not included in the amounts above.

   With respect to nuclear decontamination and property damage insurance,
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations require that nuclear plant
license-holders maintain not less than $1.1 billion of such insurance and
require the proceeds thereof to be used to place a plant in a safe and stable
condition, to decontaminate it pursuant to a plan submitted to and approved by
the NRC before the proceeds can be used for plant repair or restoration or to
provide for premature decommissioning. TXU Electric maintains nuclear
decontamination and property damage insurance for Comanche Peak in the amount
of $3.8 billion, above which TXU Electric is self-insured. The primary layer
of coverage of $500 million is provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited
(NEIL), a nuclear electric utility industry mutual insurance company. The
remaining coverage includes premature decommissioning coverage and is provided
by ANI in the amount of $500 million and additional insurance from NEIL in the
amount of $2.25 billion and $580 million from Lloyds of London, other
insurance markets and foreign nuclear insurance pools. TXU Electric is subject
to a maximum annual assessment from NEIL of $12.3 million in the event NEIL's
losses under this type of insurance for major incidents at nuclear plants
participating in these programs exceed the mutual's accumulated funds and
reinsurance.

   TXU Electric maintains Extra Expense Insurance through NEIL to cover the
additional costs of obtaining replacement power from another source if one or
both of the units at Comanche Peak are

                                     B-65
<PAGE>

out of service for more than twelve weeks as a result of covered direct
physical damage. The coverage provides for weekly payments of $3.5 million for
the first fifty-two weeks and $2.8 million for the next 110 weeks for each
outage, respectively, after the initial twelve week-period. The total maximum
coverage is $490 million per unit. The coverage amounts applicable to each
unit will be reduced to 80% if both units are out of service at the same time
as a result of the same accident. Under this coverage, TXU Electric is subject
to a maximum annual assessment of $4.1 million per year.

   Nuclear Decommissioning and Disposal of Spent Fuel -- TXU Electric has
established a reserve, charged to depreciation expense and included in
accumulated depreciation, for the decommissioning of Comanche Peak, whereby
decommissioning costs are being recovered from customers over the life of the
plant and deposited in external trust funds (included in other investments).
At December 31, 2000, such reserve totaled $192 million, which includes an
accrual of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. As of December
31, 2000, the market value of deposits in the external trust for
decommissioning of Comanche Peak was $267 million, including unrealized gains
of $75 million. Any difference between the market value of the external trust
fund and the decommissioning reserve, that represents unrealized gains or
losses of the trust fund, is treated as a regulatory asset or a regulatory
liability. Realized earnings on funds deposited in the external trust are
recognized in the reserve. Based on a site-specific study completed during
1997 using the prompt dismantlement method and 1997 dollars, decommissioning
costs for Comanche Peak Unit 1 and for Unit 2 and common facilities were
estimated to be $271 million and $404 million, respectively. This estimate is
subject to change in the future.

   Decommissioning activities are projected to begin in 2030 for Comanche Peak
Unit 1 and 2033 for Unit 2 and common facilities. TXU Electric is recovering
decommissioning costs based upon a 1992 site-specific study through rates
placed in effect under its January 1993 rate increase request.

   Legal Proceedings -- US -- In August 1998, the Gracy Fund, L.P. (Gracy
Fund) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Texas against TXU Corp., TXU Gas, David W. Biegler and Erle Nye, among
others, seeking to represent a class of purchasers of the common stock of
ENSERCH Corporation (now TXU Gas) and EEX Corporation (EEX) based upon claims
of various violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934. Also in August 1998, Stan C. Thorne filed suit in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against TXU
Gas and David W. Biegler, among others, seeking to represent a class of
purchasers of common stock of EEX. These two cases were later consolidated
(Consolidated Action). The parties to the Consolidated Action entered into an
agreement that formed the basis of the settlement of this litigation, the
terms of which required TXU Gas to pay $5 million as its portion of the
settlement. On December 28, 2000, the Court entered an Order approving the
settlement and dismissing the case.

   UK -- In February 1997, the official government representative of
pensioners (Pensions Ombudsman) made a final determination against the
National Grid Company plc (National Grid) and its group trustees with respect
to complaints by two pensioners in National Grid's section of the Electricity
Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS). The determination related to the use of the
pension fund surplus resulting from the March 31, 1992 actuarial valuation of
the National Grid section to meet certain costs arising from the payment of
pensions on early retirement upon reorganization or downsizing. This
determination was set aside by the High Court on June 10, 1997, and the
arrangements made by National Grid and its group trustees in dealing with the
surplus were confirmed. The two pensioners appealed this decision to the Court
of Appeal and judgment was received. The judgment endorsed the Pensions
Ombudsman's determination that the corporation was not entitled to
unilaterally deal with any surplus. National Grid made an appeal to the House
of Lords. The appeal was heard in February 2001 and judgment is expected to be
handed down in the second quarter of 2001. If a similar complaint were to be
made against TXU Europe in relation to its use of actuarial surplus in its
section of the ESPS, it would vigorously defend the action, ultimately through
the courts. However, if a determination were finally to be made against it and
upheld by the courts, TXU Europe

                                     B-66

could have a potential liability to repay to its section of the ESPS an amount
estimated by TXU Europe to be up to (Pounds)45 million ($67 million),
exclusive of any applicable interest charges.

   On January 25, 1999, the Hindustan Development Corporation (HDC) issued
arbitration proceedings in the Arbitral Tribunal in Delhi, India against TEG
(now Energy Holdings (No.3) Limited), claiming damages of (Pounds)255 million
($413 million) for breach of contract following the termination of a Joint
Development Agreement dated March 20, 1997 relating to the construction,
development and operation of a lignite based thermal power plant at
Barsingsar, Rajasthan. On November 21, 2000, the Arbitrators issued their
decision and dismissed HDC's claim in full, and TEG was liable for only its
own legal costs involved in the case, an estimated (Pounds)1 million ($1.5
million). On December 21, 2000, HDC filed a Request for Clarification of the
Arbitrators' decision (Request) under Section 33 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, the purpose of which is to entitle a party to arbitration to
seek clarification of language used in the Arbitrators' decision. TEG filed
its response to the Request on January 15, 2001 asserting that the Request was
untimely made and that the language used by the Arbitrators needed no
clarification. TXU Europe believes that the Arbitrators' will have no
alternative but to dismiss the Request. The effect of filing the Request ,
however, has been to stay the time HDC has to file an appeal of the
Arbitrators' decision.

   In August 2000, the Spanish Stock Market Commission announced it was
opening an investigation as to whether TXU Europe and Electrabel acted in
concert over share purchases of Hidrocantabrico in order to avoid making a
formal takeover bid. TXU Corp. was originally named as a party but is seeking
its removal from these proceedings. If the two utilities are found to be in
violation of Spanish securities law, they could face a substantial fine and
other restrictions. The investigation may last until February 2002. TXU Europe
is unable to determine what impact there may be, if any, as a result of the
investigation. TXU Europe and TXU Corp. believe there has been no violation of
Spanish securities laws and are fully cooperating with the investigation.

   General -- In addition to the above, TXU Corp. and other subsidiaries are
involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings which, in the
opinion of each, should not have a material effect upon their financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

15. SEGMENT INFORMATION

   TXU Corp. has five reportable operating segments. In 2000, TXU Corp.
renamed its US Energy Marketing Segment to US Energy and included its retail
energy services and related businesses in that segment. Prior years have been
restated to conform to current year presentation.

   (1) US Electric -- operations involving the generation, purchase,
transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in the north central,
eastern and western portions of Texas;

   (2) US Gas -- operations involving the purchase, transmission, distribution
and sale of natural gas in Texas;

   (3) US Energy -- operations involving purchasing and selling natural gas
and electricity and providing risk management and retail energy services for
the energy industry throughout the US and parts of Canada;

   (4) Europe -- operations involving the generation, purchase, distribution,
marketing and sale of electricity; the purchase and sale of natural gas; and

Europe; and

   (5) Australia -- operations involving the generation, purchase,
distribution, trading and retailing of electricity and the retailing, storage

   The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in

performance based on net income or loss. TXU Corp. accounts for intersegment
sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that
is, at current market prices.

gain of $222 million, net of estimated selling costs of $7 million. The cash
proceeds from the sale were received in January 2000. This transaction is
reflected within the 2000 Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.
