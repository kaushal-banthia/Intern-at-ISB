PROXY STATEMENT

March 30, 1998

The  accompanying  proxy  is  solicited  by the  Board of  Directors  of The AES
Corporation  (the  "Company"  or  "AES")  for  use  at  the  Annual  Meeting  of
Stockholders  of the Company to be held on Tuesday,  April 21, 1998 at 9:30 a.m.
at the  Company's  corporate  offices  at 1001  North  19th  Street,  Arlington,
Virginia 22209, or at any adjournment of such meeting.  This Proxy Statement and
accompanying  proxy are first  being sent or given to  stockholders  on or about
March 30, 1998.  If the proxy is properly  executed  and  returned by mail,  the
shares  it  represents  will be  voted at the  meeting  in  accordance  with the
instructions noted thereon. If no instructions are specified, the shares will be
voted for the  election of the  directors  and in  accordance  with the Board of
Directors'  recommendations  as set forth herein.  Any  stockholder  executing a
proxy has the power to revoke it at any time  before it is voted by filing  with
the Company a written notice of revocation,  by delivering a duly executed proxy
bearing a later date, or by attending  the Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders  and
voting in person.  Proxies marked as  abstentions,  or to withhold a vote from a
nominee as a director in the case of the  election of  directors,  will have the
effect of a negative vote.  Broker non-votes (where a nominee holding shares for
a beneficial  owner has not received  voting  instructions  from the  beneficial
owner with respect to a  particular  matter and such nominee does not possess or
choose to exercise his  discretionary  authority  with respect  thereto) will be
considered  as present at the meeting but not  entitled to vote with  respect to
the particular matter and will therefore have no effect.

The only  securities  of the  Company  entitled to be voted are shares of Common
Stock,  and only  holders of record of Common  Stock at the close of business on
March 3, 1998 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the  meeting.  Holders of
Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share.  There were 175,155,897  shares
of Common  Stock  outstanding  at the close of  business  on March 3, 1998.  The
Company's  Annual  Report for the fiscal year ended  December  31, 1997 is being
delivered concurrently with this Proxy Statement.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS



Directors  who are also  officers  of AES are not  paid  any fees or  additional
compensation for service as members of AES's Board of Directors or any committee
thereof.  Each  director who is not  employed by AES received  $26,000 as annual
compensation for service on the Board of Directors for 1997, and $1,000 for each
board  meeting  attended in person and $500 for each  meeting in which he or she
participated  by telephone  conference,  held in 1997.  For 1998, the Director's
annual  compensation  has been increased to $30,000.  The directors may elect to
receive their fees in cash, or defer the  compensation  pursuant to the Deferred
Compensation  Plan for  Directors.  All directors are  reimbursed for travel and
other  related  expenses  incurred in attending  Board and  committee  meetings.
Directors who are not employed by AES are not eligible to  participate  in AES's
employee benefit plans but participate in The AES Corporation  Stock Option Plan
for Outside  Directors  which was adopted in 1992.  Under the terms of the plan,
the Company issues options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock at a
price equal to 100% of the fair market  value on the date the option is granted.
Directors  eligible  to  participate  in the plan  receive  options  annually to
purchase common stock valued at 50% of the annual fees payable to directors,  as
determined by the Black-Scholes formula on a basis consistent with the Company's
stock option program. These options become eligible for exercise in installments
of 50% at the end of each of the first two years.



COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD

The Board has four standing  committees:  the  Financial  Audit  Committee,  the
Environmental,  Safety  and  Social  Responsibility  Committee,  the  Nominating
Committee, and the Compensation Committee.

The Financial  Audit  Committee  recommends  which firm will be appointed by the
Board of Directors as independent auditor to examine AES's financial  statements
and to perform  services  related to the audit.  The Financial  Audit  Committee
reviews  the  scope and  results  of the audit  with the  independent  auditors,
reviews with the Company and the independent auditors AES's interim and year-end
operating results, considers the adequacy of the internal accounting and control
procedures  of AES,  reviews  any  non-audit  services  to be  performed  by the
independent  auditors  and  considers  the  effect  of such  performance  on the
auditors' independence. The Financial Audit Committee met twice in 1997.

The Environmental, Safety and Social Responsibility Committee was created by the
Board in January  1997.  It monitors the  environmental  and safety  compliance,
respectively,  of the Company and its  subsidiaries and reviews and approves the
scope of the  Company's  internal  environmental  and  safety  compliance  audit
programs to consider  the  adequacy and  appropriateness  of the programs  being
planned and performed,  as well as periodically reviews the Company's commitment
to, and implementation  of, its principle to act in a socially  responsible way.
The  Environmental,  Safety and Social  Responsibility  Committee met informally
several times in 1997 to discuss a transition  program from a central  committee
responsible  for  overseeing  these  matters  to  a  more  global  decentralized
structure.

The Nominating  Committee provides  recommendations for potential nomination for
election  of new members of the Board of  Directors.  The  Nominating  Committee
considers potential  nominations  provided by stockholders and submits suggested
nominations,  when  appropriate,  to the Board of Directors  for  approval.  The
Nominating  Committee  did not meet in 1997.  Stockholders  wishing to recommend
persons for  consideration by the Nominating  Committee as nominees for election
to the Company's Board of Directors can do so by writing to the Secretary of the
Company at 1001 North 19th Street,  Arlington,  Virginia 22209, giving each such
person's name,  biographical data and  qualifications.  Any such  recommendation
should be accompanied by a written statement from the

                                       5

<PAGE>



person  recommended  of his or her  consent  to be named as a  nominee  and,  if
nominated  and  elected,  to serve as a director.  The  Company's  By-Laws  also
contain a procedure for stockholder nomination of directors. (See "Submission of
Stockholder Proposals and Nominations" below.)

The Compensation Committee establishes rates of salary,  bonuses, profit sharing
contributions,  grants of stock options,  retirement and other  compensation for
all  directors  and  officers of AES and for such other  people as the Board may
designate.  All of the members of this  committee  are  "disinterested  persons"
under the provisions of Rule 16b-3 adopted under the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act").  The  Compensation  Committee's  primary
responsibility  is to formulate  and maintain  the  compensation  program of the
Company  in order to  develop,  retain  (and  attract,  when  necessary)  people
important to the Company's  performance.  This  committee  specifically  acts to
evaluate  the  performance  and set the  total  compensation  for the  executive
officers of the Company,  including the CEO, in accordance  with the  guidelines
discussed  below.  This  committee  has  delegated  to the CEO the  power to set
compensation for the non-executive officers. The Compensation Committee met once
in 1997.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The Compensation  Committee's (the  "Committee")  guidelines for compensation of
executive  officers are designed to provide fair and competitive levels of total
compensation  while  integrating  pay  with  performance.   Executive  officers,
including  the CEO,  are  evaluated  annually  on the  basis of both  individual
responsibilities  and  contributions,  as well as  Company-wide  results  in two
related  areas:  (i)  corporate  culture (or  principles)  and (ii)  business or
functional area performance.

There  are  three  elements  in the  Company's  executive  officer  compensation
program. These elements are:

     o    Base salary

     o    Annual incentive compensation

     o    Stock option program

Base  salary is  adjusted  annually  by the  Committee  to account  for  general
economic and cost of living changes.  Adjustments are also made  periodically to
recognize significant new or additional responsibilities of individual executive
officers.  The  Committee's  guidelines are to provide base salary  compensation
generally   consistent  with  its   interpretation   of  industry  averages  for
individuals with similar responsibility levels.

Annual  incentive  compensation  is based  upon both  objective  and  subjective
measures in the areas of  corporate  culture and  business  or  functional  area
performance,  and generally  takes the form of bonuses  payable after  year-end.
With respect to corporate culture,  the Company's shared principles of fairness,
integrity,  fun and social  responsibility  are integral to its  operations  and
serve as its founding  principles or values.  These  principles apply equally to
the internal  activities  of the Company as well as its external  relationships.
Each executive officer's individual  contribution to demonstrating and nurturing
these shared values is reviewed by the  Committee and  considered as a factor in
determining annual incentive compensation.  Evaluations by the Committee in this
area are inherently subjective.

The second area considered in the determination of annual incentive compensation
is the individual  executive  officer's  performance  with respect to his or her
related business  responsibilities and/ or functional area. Although all aspects
of  an  individual's  responsibilities  are  considered  in  determining  annual
incentive compensation,  several quantitative measures of annual performance are
considered  significant,  including  operating  margin  improvements,  operating
reliability, earnings per share contributions, environmental performance,

                                       6

<PAGE>



and  plant  and  Company-wide   safety.   The  qualitative   factors  considered
significant  include  business  and  project  development  progress,   effective
planning, Company-wide support, community relations and people development.

Important  strategic  successes or failures can take several  years to translate
into  objectively  measurable  results.  The Committee  does not compute  annual
incentive   compensation   using  a  mathematical   formula  of   pre-determined
performance goals and objective criteria.  As a result, the Committee's ultimate
determination of the amount, if any, of annual incentive compensation is made at
the end of each year based on a subjective  evaluation  of several  quantitative
and qualitative factors,  with primary emphasis given this year to those factors
listed in the  preceding  paragraph.  There are no targeted,  minimum or maximum
levels  of  annual  incentive  compensation,  and  such  compensation  does  not
necessarily  bear  any  consistent  relationship  to  salary  amounts  or  total
compensation.

The Company's stock option program provides  longer-term  incentives using stock
ownership to encourage  people  within the Company to think and act like owners.
All executive  officers and approximately 59% of the total people in the Company
located in the United States  participate  in this program.  The Company is also
taking steps to incorporate those people who reside outside of the United States
into this program by  qualifying  its stock  option plan (or a similar  plan) in
each  country  where AES people  currently  reside or work.  Stock  options  are
usually  granted  annually  at the fair  market  value on the date of grant  and
provide vesting  periods to reward people for continued  service to the Company.
The  Committee's  determination  of the  number  of  options  to be  granted  to
executive  officers  is based  upon the same  factors as such  officer's  annual
incentive  compensation  discussed above with additional  consideration given to
the number of options previously granted. 

Since 1994,  the Company has  participated  in an annual survey  conducted by an
outside  consulting firm which encompasses over 400 public  companies.  Based in
part on the survey results, the Committee  established  guidelines for suggested
ranges of option grants to executive  officers as well as the rest of the people
in the Company.  Based on the survey, the Committee established guideline ranges
for  eligible  participants  between  the 50th and 90th  percentile  of  similar
companies.  As with  annual  incentive  compensation,  the  determination  of an
individual's  grant is subjective  and although the  Committee  has  established
suggested guidelines, the grants are not formula based.

Total compensation is reviewed to determine whether amounts are competitive with
other companies  whose  operations are similar in type, size and complexity with
those of the  Company,  as well as a broad range of similarly  sized  companies.
Comparisons are made with published amounts, where available,  and, from time to
time, the Company also participates in various  industry-sponsored  compensation
surveys  in  addition  to  the   public-company   survey  described  above.  The
industry-related  companies include companies in the Peer Group Index as well as
other similar  non-public  companies who  participate in industry  surveys.  The
Committee also has, in the past, engaged an independent  compensation consultant
to  specifically  review  the level and  appropriateness  of  executive  officer
compensation.  Other than as  described  above,  the Company uses the results of
surveys,  when available,  for  informational  purposes only and does not target
individual  elements of or total  compensation  to any specific  range of survey
results  (i.e.,  high,  low or  median)  other  than the  Committee's  suggested
guidelines  for stock option  grants as  discussed  in the  previous  paragraph.
Because each individual's compensation is determined, in part, by experience and
performance, actual compensation generally varies from industry averages.

Executive  officers also  participate  in the Company's  profit sharing plan (or
deferred  compensation  plan for  executive  officers)  on the same terms as all
other people in the Company, subject to

                                       7

<PAGE>



any legal limitations on amounts that may be contributed or benefits that may be
payable  under  the plan.  Matching  contributions  and  annual  profit  sharing
contributions are made with the common stock of the Company to further encourage
long-term  performance.   In  addition,   certain  individuals  of  the  Company
participate  in the  Company's  supplemental  retirement  plan,  which  provides
supplemental  retirement benefits to "highly compensated  employees" (as defined
in the Internal  Revenue Code) of any amount which would be  contributed on such
individual's behalf under the profit sharing plan (or the deferred  compensation
plan  for  executive  officers)  but  is  not  so  contributed  because  of  the
limitations contained in the Internal Revenue Code.

In most  cases,  the  Committee  has taken  steps to qualify  income paid to any
officer as a deductible  business expense pursuant to regulations  issued by the
Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
with respect to qualifying  compensation paid to executive officers in excess of
$1 million.  Compensation  earned  pursuant to the  exercise of options  granted
under the Company's former stock option plan (which was discontinued in 1991) is
not considered  for purposes of the $1 million  aggregate  limit,  and exercises
under the 1991 Plan are  similarly  excluded.  The  Committee  will  continue to
consider the  implications  to the Company of qualifying all  compensation  as a
deductible  expense  under  Section 162 (m), but retains the  discretion  to pay
bonuses commensurate with an executive officer's contributions to the success of
the Company,  irrespective of whether such amounts are entirely deductible.  For
1997,  portions of Mr.  Bakke's cash  compensation  may not be deductible  under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

MR. BAKKE'S 1997 COMPENSATION

Mr. Bakke's compensation for 1997 was reviewed and approved by the Committee
utilizing the guidelines discussed above. Specifically, the following primarily
positive factors considered were:

     o    Strong adherence by the people in the Company to its shared principles
          of integrity, fairness, social responsibility and fun, as indicated by
          the Company's internal values survey.

     o    Improvement toward  integrating shared principles,  including improved
          awareness and  commitment  by AES people to the  Company's  principles
          (especially with respect to newly-acquired businesses).

     o    Increase in the price of the Company's Common Stock from year end 1996
          to year end 1997 of approximately 100%.

     o    Net income and diluted  earnings per share  increased 48% and 36% from
          1996 to 1997, respectively.

     o    Significant  development  of new project and  business  opportunities,
          including:

          o    CEMIG, an integrated utility in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil

          o    EDEN and EDES, two distribution companies serving the province of
               Buenos Aires, Argentina

          o    AES Sul, a distribution  company  serving the state of Rio Grande
               do Sul, Brazil

          o    Tau Power, an electricity and heating system in East Kazakstan

          o    Destec  Energy's  international  businesses,  consisting  of five
               plants in  construction  or operation,  and numerous  projects in
               development

          o    Numerous  project  development  successes  represented by project
               financings,  commencement  of  construction  or new  power  sales
               contract awards, in Brazil,  Mexico,  Argentina,  Australia,  the
               United Kingdom and Pennsylvania

                                       8

<PAGE>



          o    Successful   completion  of  the  amalgamation   with  AES  China
               Generating Co. Ltd.

          o    Commencement of commercial operation of AES Lal Pir in Pakistan.

          o    Successful  public issuance of $825 million  aggregate  principal
               amount  of  senior  subordinated  notes,  $550  million  of  term
               convertible preferred  securities,  $509 million of common stock,
               and an increase in the Company's  short-term  credit  facility to
               $600 million.

          o    An exceptional year in plant reliability and availability  across
               the Company.

          o    Continued  excellent  environmental  performance  below permitted
               levels (on average).

          o    An increase in the Company's backlog of sales from $80 billion to
               $115 billion.

          o    An increase in total net megawatts in operation,  construction or
               under advanced development from approximately 9,000 to 18,000.

The following primarily negative factors considered were:

          o    While the Company's overall safety record continued to improve in
               1997,  several very serious  injuries  occurred,  including three
               (two amongst the Company's  contractors) that resulted in loss of
               life.



Based on a subjective evaluation considering all of these factors, the Committee
determined that an increase in total cash compensation of approximately 52% from
1996 to 1997 was  appropriate  as compared  to an increase  from 1995 to 1996 of
approximately  40%. Of the total 1996 to 1997 increase,  Mr. Bakke's base salary
increased  approximately  10% and his bonus increased  approximately  76%. Stock
option  grants were for 55,209  shares.  Stock  options were granted at the fair
market value of the underlying  shares on the date of grant and vest at the rate
of 50% per year through December 1999.

(1)  All options are for shares of Common Stock of the Company.  Options granted
     for services performed in 1997 were granted at the fair market value on the
     date of grant, and vest at the rate of 50% per year through December 1999.

(2)  The  Black-Scholes  stock option  pricing model was used to value the stock
     options on the grant date  (December 3, 1997).  The  Company's  assumptions
     under this model include an expected volatility of 39.5%, a 5.86% risk free
     rate of return and no dividends. The options have 10 year terms and vest at
     50% per  year.  There  were no  adjustments  made to  account  for  vesting
     provisions, and no adjustments were made for non-transferability or risk of
     forfeiture.

     The use of such  amounts and  assumptions  are not intended to forecast any
     possible  future  appreciation  of the  Company's  stock  price or dividend
     policy.

PROPOSAL 2
APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS

The  Board  of  Directors  has  appointed  Deloitte  &  Touche  LLP,  a firm  of
independent   public   accountants,   as  auditors  to  examine  and  report  to
stockholders for the year 1998. Deloitte & Touche LLP has acted as the Company's
independent   auditors   since  1981.   The   appointment   was  made  upon  the
recommendation  of the  Financial  Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors.
Representatives  of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual  Meeting
and  will be  given  an  opportunity  to make a  statement.  They  also  will be
available to respond to appropriate questions.

The Board of Directors  recommends that the stockholders  ratify the appointment
of Deloitte & Touche LLP,  and intends to introduce  at the  forthcoming  Annual
Meeting the following resolution (designated herein as Proposal 2):

      "RESOLVED,  that the  appointment  by the Board of Directors of Deloitte &
      Touche LLP as  independent  auditors for this Company for the year 1998 is
      hereby approved, ratified and confirmed."

The  affirmative  vote of the  holders of a majority  of shares of Common  Stock
entitled  to notice of and to vote at the  Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders,  at
which a quorum is present,  is necessary for the ratification of the appointment
of Deloitte & Touche LLP as  independent  auditors  for the Company for the year
1998.

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS

Any stockholder  entitled to vote in the election of directors and who meets the
requirements  of the proxy rules under the  Exchange Act may submit to the Board
of Directors  proposals to be considered for submission to the  stockholders  at
the 1999 Annual  Meeting.  Any such  proposal  should be submitted in writing by
notice delivered or mailed by first-class  United States mail,  postage prepaid,
to the  Secretary,  The AES  Corporation,  1001  North 19th  Street,  Arlington,
Virginia  22209 and must be received no later than  November 23, 1998.  Any such
notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder and the text
of the  proposal  to be  introduced;  (b) the  number of shares of stock held of
record,  owned  beneficially  and represented by proxy by such stockholder as of
the date of such notice; and (c) a representation  that the stockholder  intends
to appear  in  person  or by proxy at the  meeting  to  introduce  the  proposal
specified  in  the  notice.  The  chairperson  of  the  meeting  may  refuse  to
acknowledge the introduction of any stockholder  proposal not made in compliance
with the foregoing procedure.

AES's By-Laws contain a procedure for stockholder  nomination of directors.  The
By-Laws provide that any record owner of stock entitled to be voted generally in
the  election of  directors  may  nominate one or more persons for election as a
director  at a  stockholders  meeting  only if  written  notice  is given to the
Secretary  of AES of the  intent to make such  nomination.  The  notice  must be
given,  with respect to an annual meeting,  not later than 90 days in advance of
such annual  meeting and with respect to a special  meeting,  not later than the
close of business on the  seventh day  following  the earlier of (a) the date on
which notice of such special meeting is first given to stockholders  and (b) the
date on which a pub-

                                       14
