PROXY STATEMENT

March 22, 2001

The accompanying proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors of The AES
Corporation (the "Company" or "AES") for use at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders of the Company to be held on Thursday, April 19, 2001 at 9:30 a.m.
at the Company's corporate offices at 1001 North 19th Street, Arlington,
Virginia 22209, or at any adjournment of such meeting. This Proxy Statement and
accompanying proxy are first being sent or given to stockholders on or about
March 22, 2001.

If the proxy is properly executed, the shares it represents will be voted at the
meeting in accordance with the instructions noted thereon. If no instructions
are specified, the shares will be voted for the election of directors and in
accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendations as set forth herein. Any
stockholder executing a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it
is voted by filing with the Company a written notice of revocation, by
delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by attending the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders and voting in person. Proxies marked as
abstentions, or to withhold a vote from a nominee as a director in the case of
the election of directors, will have the effect of a negative vote. Broker
non-votes (where a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner has not
received voting instructions from the beneficial owner with respect to a
particular matter and such nominee does not possess or choose to exercise his
discretionary authority with respect thereto) will be considered as present at
the meeting but not entitled to vote with respect to the particular matter and
will therefore have no effect.

The only securities of the Company entitled to be voted are shares of Common
Stock, and only holders of record of Common Stock at the close of business on
March 2, 2001 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. Holders of
Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. There were 490,226,393 shares
of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on March 2, 2001. The
Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 is being
delivered concurrently with this Proxy Statement.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

Directors who are also officers of AES are not paid any fees or additional
compensation for service as members of AES's Board of Directors or any committee
thereof. Each director who is not employed by AES received $30,000 as annual
cash compensation for service on the Board of Directors for 2000, and $1,000 for
each board meeting attended in person and $500 for each meeting in which he or
she participated by telephone conference. The directors may elect to defer this
compensation pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors in the
form of stock units. All directors are reimbursed for travel and other related
expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings. Beginning in 2001,
fees for each Board meeting attended in person has been increased to $2,000 per
meeting, and the fee for each telephone conference has been increased to $750.
In addition, each Director shall be paid $2,000 per day for each day of the
Company's quarterly business meetings he/she attends. Directors who are not
employed by AES are not eligible to participate in AES's employee benefit plans
but participate in The AES Corporation Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors
that was adopted in 1992. Under the terms of the plan, the Company issues
options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock at a price equal to the
quoted market price on the date the option is granted. Directors eligible to
participate in the plan receive options annually to purchase Common Stock valued
on the grant date at $40,000. These options become eligible for exercise in
installments of 50% at the end of each of the first two years. For 2001, upon
approval of The AES Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors by
stockholders, the Board will have an additional payment alternative. Directors
may elect to take their annual cash compensation consisting of the $30,000
annual fee, the $40,000 annual stock option grant, plus four regular meeting
fees aggregating $8,000 in the form of a stock option award. For each Director
so electing, they will receive stock options equal to 1.15 times the cash value,
and such stock option grants shall vest within one year of grant.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD

The Board has four standing committees: the Financial Audit Committee, the
Environmental, Safety and Social Responsibility Committee, the Nominating
Committee, and the Compensation Committee.

The Financial Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") recommends which firm will
be appointed by the Board of Directors as independent auditor to examine AES's
financial statements and to perform services related to the audit.

Audit Committee Report

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the review and
oversight of the Company's performance with respect to its financial
responsibilities and the integrity of the Company's accounting and reporting
practices. The Audit Committee also recommends to the Board of Directors the
selection of the Company's independent auditors. The Audit Committee is composed
of four non-employee directors and operates under a written charter adopted and
approved by the Board of Directors. Each Audit Committee member is independent
as defined by NYSE listing standards. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is
attached to this Proxy Statement.

                                       6
<PAGE>
The Company, not the Audit Committee nor the independent auditor, is responsible
for the preparation of its financial statements and its operating results and
for the appropriate safekeeping of the Company's assets. The independent
auditor's responsibility is to attest to the fair presentation of the financial
statements. The independent auditor is accountable to the Board and the Audit
Committee, and the Board and Audit Committee have the ultimate authority and
responsibility to select, evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the
independent auditor. The role of the Audit Committee is to be satisfied that
both the Company and the independent auditor discharge their respective
responsibilities effectively. However, no member of the Audit Committee is
professionally engaged in the practice of accounting or auditing and is not
expert in the fields of accounting or auditing, including with respect to
auditor independence. The Audit Committee relies, without independent
verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made
by management and the independent auditors.

The Audit Committee held six meetings during fiscal 2000. The meetings were
designed, among other things, to facilitate and encourage communication among
the Audit Committee, the Company, and the Company's independent auditors,
Deloitte & Touche LLP. The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's
independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits,
and met with the independent auditors, with and without management present, to
discuss the results of their examinations and their evaluations of the Company's
internal controls.

The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 with management
and Deloitte & Touche.

The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent auditors matters
required to be discussed with audit committees under generally accepted auditing
standards, including, among other things, matters related to the conduct of the
audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and the matters
required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended
(Communication with Audit Committees).

The Company's independent auditors also provided to the Audit Committee the
written disclosures and the letter required by Independence Standards Board
Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), and discussed
with the Audit Committee their independence from the Company. When considering
Deloitte & Touche's independence, the Audit Committee considered whether their
provision of services to the Company beyond those rendered in connection with
their audit and review of the Company's consolidated financial statements was
compatible with maintaining their independence. The Audit Committee also
reviewed, among other things, the amount of fees paid to Deloitte & Touche for
audit and non-audit services. (Please see Principal Accounting Firm Fees chart
located in the section of the Proxy marked, "General".)

Based on its review and these meetings, discussions and reports, and subject to
the limitations on its role and responsibilities referred to above and in the
Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of
Directors that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 be included

                                       7
<PAGE>
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Audit Committee also
recommended the selection of the Company's independent auditors, and, based on
such recommendation, the Board has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as the
Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.

The Environmental, Safety and Social Responsibility Committee monitors the
environmental and safety compliance, respectively, of the Company and its
subsidiaries and reviews and approves the scope of the Company's internal
environmental and safety compliance audit programs to consider the adequacy and
appropriateness of the programs being planned and performed, as well as
periodically reviews the Company's commitment to, and implementation of, its
principle to act in a socially responsible way. The Environmental, Safety and
Social Responsibility Committee met once in 2000.

The Nominating Committee provides recommendations for potential nomination for
election of new members of the Board of Directors. The Nominating Committee
considers potential nominations provided by stockholders and submits suggested
nominations, when appropriate, to the Board of Directors for approval. The
Nominating Committee met once in 2000. Stockholders wishing to recommend persons
for consideration by the Nominating Committee as nominees for election to the
Company's Board of Directors can do so by writing to the Secretary of the
Company at 1001 North 19th Street, Arlington, Virginia 22209, giving each such
person's name, biographical data and qualifications. Any such recommendation
should be accompanied by a written statement from the person recommended of his
or her consent to be named as a nominee and, if nominated and elected, to serve
as a director. The Company's By-Laws also contain a procedure for stockholder
nomination of directors. (See "Submission of Stockholder Proposals and
Nominations" below.)

The Compensation Committee establishes rates of salary, bonuses, profit sharing
contributions, grants of stock options, retirement and other compensation for
all directors and officers of AES and for such other people as the Board may
designate. All of the members of this committee are "disinterested persons"
under the provisions of Rule 16b-3 adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Compensation Committee's primary
responsibility is to formulate and maintain the compensation program of the
Company in order to develop, retain (and attract, when necessary) people
important to the Company's performance. This committee specifically acts to
evaluate the performance and set the total compensation for the executive
officers of the Company, including the CEO, in accordance with the guidelines
discussed below. This committee has delegated to the CEO the power to set
compensation for the non-executive officers. The Compensation Committee met one
time in 2000.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The Compensation Committee's (the "Committee") guidelines for compensation of
executive officers are designed to provide fair and competitive levels of total
compensation while integrating pay with performance. Executive officers,
including the CEO, are

                                       8
<PAGE>
evaluated annually on the basis of both individual responsibilities and
contributions, as well as Company-wide results in two related areas: (i)
corporate culture (or principles) and (ii) business or functional area
performance.

There are three elements in the Company's executive officer compensation, which
is consistent with how most people who work for the Company are compensated.
These elements are base salary, annual incentive compensation, and stock option
program. Beginning in 1999, Mr. Bakke's compensation was granted exclusively in
stock options. See below for a more complete description. Certain executive
officers may be compensated similarly in the future.

Base salary is adjusted annually by the Committee to account for general
economic and cost of living changes. Adjustments are also made periodically to
recognize significant new or additional responsibilities of individual executive
officers. The Committee's guidelines are to provide base salary compensation
generally consistent with its interpretation of industry averages for
individuals with similar responsibility levels.

Annual incentive compensation is based upon both objective and subjective
measures in the areas of corporate culture and business or functional area
performance, and generally takes the form of bonuses payable after year-end.
With respect to corporate culture, the Company's shared principles of fairness,
integrity, fun and social responsibility are integral to its operations and
serve as its founding principles. These principles apply equally to the internal
activities of the Company as well as its external relationships. Each executive
officer's individual contribution to demonstrating and nurturing these shared
values is reviewed and considered as a factor in determining annual incentive
compensation. Evaluations by the Committee in this area are inherently
subjective.

The second area considered in the determination of annual compensation is the
individual executive officer's performance with respect to his or her related
business responsibilities and/or functional area. Although all aspects of an
individual's responsibilities are considered in determining annual compensation,
several quantitative measures of annual performance are considered significant,
including operating margin improvements, operating reliability, earnings per
share contributions, environmental performance, and plant and Company-wide
safety. The qualitative factors considered significant include business and
project development progress, effective strategic planning and implementation,
Company-wide support, understanding of and adherence to the Company's values,
and community relations and people development.

Important strategic successes or failures can take several years to translate
into objectively measurable results. The Committee does not compute annual
incentive compensation using a mathematical formula of pre-determined
performance goals and objective criteria. As a result, the Committee's ultimate
determination of the amount, if any, of annual incentive compensation is made at
the end of each year based on a subjective evaluation of several quantitative
and qualitative factors, with primary emphasis given this year to those factors
listed in the preceding paragraph. There are no targeted, minimum or maximum
levels of annual incentive compensation, and such compensation does not
necessarily bear any consistent relationship to salary amounts or total
compensation.

                                       9
<PAGE>
The Company's stock option program is used to reward people for the corporate
responsibilities they undertake, their performance of those duties and to help
them to think and act like owners. All executive officers and approximately 75%
of the total people in the Company located in the United States (approximately
4% of AES people worldwide) participate in this program. Historically, because
of differing legal environments in many countries, options had been primarily
granted to U.S. people. However, the Company has taken steps to incorporate
those people who reside outside of the United States into this program by
qualifying its stock option plan in each country where AES people currently
reside or work, and the Company expects the total participation to increase in
the future. Stock options are usually granted annually at the market price of
the Common Stock on the date of grant and provide vesting periods to reward
people for continued service to the Company. The Committee's determination of
the number of options to be granted to executive officers is based upon the same
factors as such officer's annual incentive compensation discussed above with
additional consideration given to the number of options previously granted.

Since 1994, the Company has participated in an annual survey conducted by an
outside consulting firm that encompasses over 400 public companies. Based in
part on the survey results, the Committee established guidelines for suggested
ranges of option grants to executive officers as well as the rest of the people
in the Company. Based on the survey, the Committee established guideline ranges
for eligible participants between the 50th and 90th percentile of similar
companies. As with annual incentive compensation, the determination of an
individual's grant is subjective and although the Committee has established
suggested guidelines, the grants are not formula based.

Total compensation is reviewed to determine whether amounts are competitive with
other companies whose operations are similar in type, size and complexity with
those of the Company, as well as a broad range of similarly sized companies.
Comparisons are made with published amounts, where available, and, from time to
time, the Company also participates in various industry-sponsored compensation
surveys in addition to the public-company survey described above. The Committee
also has, in the past, engaged an independent compensation consultant to
specifically review the level and appropriateness of executive officer
compensation. Other than as described above, the Company uses the results of
surveys, when available, for informational purposes only and does not target
individual elements of or total compensation to any specific range of survey
results (i.e., high, low or median) other than the Committee's suggested
guidelines for stock option grants as discussed in the previous paragraph.
Because each individual's compensation is determined, in part, by experience and
performance, actual compensation generally varies from industry averages.

Executive officers also participate in the Company's profit sharing plan (or
deferred compensation plan for executive officers) on the same terms as all
other people in the Company, subject to any legal limitations on amounts that
may be contributed or benefits that may be payable under the plan. Matching
contributions and annual profit sharing contributions are made with the Common
Stock of the Company to further encourage long-term performance. In addition,
certain individuals of the Company participate in the Company's supplemental

                                       10
<PAGE>
retirement plan, which provides supplemental retirement benefits to "highly
compensated employees" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) of any amount
which would be contributed on such individual's behalf under the profit sharing
plan (or the deferred compensation plan for executive officers) but is not so
contributed because of the limitations contained in the Internal Revenue Code.

In most cases, the Committee has taken steps to qualify income paid to any
officer as a deductible business expense pursuant to regulations issued by the
Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
with respect to qualifying compensation paid to executive officers in excess of
$1 million. Compensation earned pursuant to the exercise of options granted
under the Company's former stock option plan (which was discontinued in 1991) is
not considered for purposes of the $1 million aggregate limit, and exercises
under the 1991 Plan are similarly excluded. The Committee will continue to
consider the implications to the Company of qualifying all compensation as a
deductible expense under Section 162 (m), but retains the discretion to pay
bonuses commensurate with an executive officer's contributions to the success of
the Company, irrespective of whether such amounts are entirely deductible.

MR. BAKKE'S 2000 COMPENSATION

Mr. Bakke's compensation for 2000 was reviewed and approved by the Committee
utilizing the guidelines discussed above. Specifically, the following primarily
positive factors considered were:

- - Strong adherence, understanding, and awareness by the people in the Company to
  its shared principles of integrity, fairness, social responsibility and fun,
  as indicated by the Company's internal values survey, with particular emphasis
  made on excellent progress made at the Company's foreign subsidiaries.

- - Significant development of new project and business opportunities, including
  among others:

    - The acquisition of a majority interest in C.A. La Eletricidad de Caracas
      and Corporacion EDC, C.A.;

    - The consolidation of AES's interest in Light-Servicos de Eletricidad S.A.
      and Metropolitana Eletricidad de Sao Paulo S.A.;

    - The agreement to acquire IPALCO Enterprises Inc.;

    - The acquisition of a 49% interest held by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd in the
      Songo Songo Gas-to-Electricity Project in Tanzania;

    - The acquisition of Reliant Energy International's interest in El Salvador
      Energy Holdings, S.A., which owns three distribution companies in El
      Salvador;

    - The acquisition of a 98% stake in the 1,000 MW hydroelectric facility of
      Hidroelectrica Alicura S.A. in Argentina;

    - The commencement of construction of a $340 million electric power plant
      and liquefied natural gas importing facility located in the Dominican
      Republic;

    - The acquisition of Redibol, a competitive access provider based in La Paz,
      Bolivia;

    - The completion of a tender offer to acquire a majority interest in Gener
      S.A.;

                                       11
<PAGE>
    - The acquisition of KMR Power Corporation in Colombia including two natural
      gas fired power plants having a total capacity of approximately 414MW;

    - Award of electricity and desalination project in the Sultanate of Oman;

    - Numerous project financing and refinancings totaling over $7 billion.

- - Successful corporate issuance of approximately $1,440 million of common
  equity, $460 million term convertible preferred securities, $1,150 million
  aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and $1,450 million of bank
  facilities.

- - An increase in the price of the Company's common stock of 48% in 2000.

- - An exceptional year in plant reliability and availability.

- - Continued excellent environmental performance below permitted levels (on
  average).

- - An increase in total net megawatts in operation, construction, or under
  advanced or pending acquisition development from approximately 44,000 to
  64,000.

The following primarily negative factors considered were:

- - While the Company's overall safety record continued to improve in 2000,
  several very serious injuries occurred, including eight that resulted in loss
  of life.

The Committee decided that, beginning in 1999, Mr. Bakke would no longer receive
cash as part of his overall compensation. Mr. Bakke is compensated solely by the
grant of stock options (in lieu of a cash salary and cash bonus). The Committee
believes that this method of compensation will align Mr. Bakke's compensation
more closely with the financial interests of the Company's other stockholders.

Mr. Bakke's total 2000 compensation (including the estimated fair value of
options granted using the Black-Scholes formula) increased 49% over his 1999
compensation.

(1) All options are for shares of Common Stock of the Company. Options granted
    for services performed in 2000 were granted at the quoted market price of
    the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant, and vest at the rate of 50%
    per year through January 2003.

(2) The Black-Scholes stock option pricing model was used to value the stock
    options on the grant date (January 31, 2001). The Company's assumptions
    under this model include an expected volatility of 47.05%, a 5.26% risk free
    rate of return, no dividends, and a vesting adjustment of 4.5%. The options
    have 10 year terms and vest at 50% per year. No adjustments were made for
    non-transferability or risk of forfeiture.

    The use of such amounts and assumptions are not intended to forecast any
    possible future appreciation of the Company's stock price or dividend
    policy.

PEER GROUP INDEX*

The 2000 Peer Group consists of the following publicly traded companies in the
global power generation industry: Edison International, CMS Energy Corporation,
and International Power, PLC. Last year, the Company's Peer Group included
Mid-American Energy Company, Inc. ("MAEC"). Since February 2000, MAEC ceased
trading as a public company, and could no longer be included in AES' Peer Group
index.

The 2000 Peer Group Index reflects the weighted average total return for the
entire Peer Group calculated for the period in which the Company's equity
securities were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to the Exchange Act, from a base of 100. In compliance with Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations, the returns of each company in the 2000 Peer
Group Index have been weighted according to their market capitalization as of
the beginning of the period.

PROPOSAL 2
APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF 2001 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN

The Board of Directors has adopted The AES Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan
(the "2001 Option Plan") and recommends it for stockholder approval at the
forthcoming Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors believes that the 2001 Option
Plan will encourage and promote the growth and prosperity of AES by allowing
employees of AES and its affiliates to continue to share in the stock ownership
of AES. The AES Corporation Incentive Stock Option Plan, AES's previous stock
option plan, expires pursuant to its terms on June 1, 2001 with respect to
future grant of options.

There follows a brief description of the principal features of the 2001 Option
Plan.

SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS. The total number of shares of Common Stock
for which options can be granted pursuant to the 2001 Option Plan is 15,000,000
shares, subject to adjustment for any merger or other corporation transaction or
event as described below under "RECAPITALIZATION". Subject to such adjustment,
no participant may receive options in any calendar year that relate to more than
1 million shares of Common Stock. Shares underlying substitute options, as
described below under "ELIGIBILITY", will not be counted against shares
available for future grants of options under the 2001 Option Plan.

AES will reserve, either from authorized but unissued Common Stock or from
Common Stock reacquired by AES and held in its treasury, the full number of
shares of Common Stock necessary to satisfy all options that may be granted
under the 2001 Option Plan.

ADMINISTRATION. The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of
Directors has been designated to administer the 2001 Option Plan.

Subject to the provisions of the 2001 Option Plan and any restrictions that the
Board of Directors may make, the Committee will have authority to prescribe,
amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the 2001 Option Plan, to
construe all plan provisions and to determine any and all questions arising
under the 2001 Option Plan. The Committee will determine the manner, timing and
amount of any options granted pursuant to the 2001 Option Plan. The
determination of the Committee will be binding and conclusive on all persons.

                                       17
<PAGE>
The Committee may delegate its power under the 2001 Option Plan to each of the
Chairman of the Board of Directors and the President of the Company, with
respect to options that may be granted to employees who are not officers or
directors or beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Common Stock, subject to
the requirements of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

ELIGIBILITY. Any person who is a common law employee of AES or an affiliate will
be eligible to participate in the 2001 Option Plan. Holders of options granted
by a company acquired by AES or with which AES combines may be granted
substitute options to purchase Common Stock under the 2001 Option Plan.
Currently, approximately 44,000 employees are eligible for options under the
2001 Option Plan.

OPTIONS GENERALLY. Options granted under the 2001 Option Plan may either be
nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options qualifying under Section
422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The options that participants will be granted
under the 2001 Option Plan are not yet determinable, as these options will be
granted at the determination of the Committee.

Each option will be in writing, and such writing will specify the number of
shares of Common Stock which may be purchased pursuant to the option, the
purchase price, the period during which the option may be exercised and other
conditions, if any, under which the option has been granted. Unless the
Committee determines otherwise, such writing will also provide for any vesting
of the option. Unless specifically provided to the contrary in such a writing,
upon a "change of control" of AES, all options will become fully vested and
exercisable. The 2001 Option Plan defines "change of control" to include (i) any
person or group acquiring 30% or more of the Company's voting stock, (ii)
replacement of more than half of the current directors of the Company, except by
individuals whose appointment or nomination for election was approved by the
current board (including such additionally approved individuals) and (iii)
stockholder approval of a merger of the Company, except for any merger that
would result in the voting securities of the Company continuing to represent
more than 51% of the successor entity.

RECAPITALIZATION. In the event of any merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off,
combination or exchange of shares, or other recapitalization or change in
capitalization or other similar corporate transaction or event that affects
AES's Common Stock or other securities of AES and the Committee determines that
an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the
benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2001
Option Plan, the Committee will, as it deems equitable adjust any or all of:

- - the number of shares of Common Stock (or number and kind of other securities
  or property) which may be made the subject of options, including the aggregate
  and individual limits described above under "SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE
  GRANTS",

- - the number of shares of Common Stock (or number and kind of other securities
  or property) subject to outstanding options, and

- - the grant, purchase or exercise price with respect to any option.

In the alternative, if deemed appropriate, the Committee will make provision for
a cash payment to an optionee.

In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or other
subdivision or

                                       18
<PAGE>
combination of the Common Stock or other securities of the Company, the items
above will be adjusted automatically.

TRANSFERABILITY. No option granted under the 2001 Option Plan will be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of by any optionee or by any other person
having any rights to the option, other than by will or by the laws of descent
and distribution.

NONEXCLUSIVITY. Nothing contained in the 2001 Option Plan will preclude the
Company from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation
arrangements, and any such arrangements may be generally applicable, or
applicable only in specific cases.

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT. The 2001 Option Plan will terminate no later than
January 1, 2011. Notwithstanding this, AES reserves the right to change, amend,
modify or terminate the 2001 Option Plan (or any portion of the 2001 Option
Plan) at any time; provided, however, that AES will not amend the 2001 Option
Plan to increase the aggregate shares available for future grants, other than as
provided for above in "RECAPITALIZATION", without also seeking stockholder
approval. However, stockholder approval must be obtained if such approval is
necessary to qualify for or comply with any tax or regulatory status or
requirement for which or with which the Board of Directors deems it necessary or
desirable to qualify or comply. The Committee may amend the 2001 Option Plan in
such manner as may be necessary so as to have the plan conform to local rules
and regulations in any jurisdiction outside the United States.

In addition, subject to the terms of the 2001 Option Plan and applicable law,
the Committee may waive any conditions or rights under or change, amend, modify
or terminate any option, prospectively or retroactively.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES. The following summarizes the tax
consequences of option grants under the 2001 Option Plan under U.S. federal
income tax laws as currently in effect. The recipient of an option will
recognize no income, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, upon the grant of an
option under the 2001 Option Plan. If the option is a nonqualified option, then
the optionee will recognize, upon exercise of the option, ordinary income in an
amount equal to the excess of the fair market value, at exercise, of the Common
Stock acquired over the exercise price of such option. The Company will be
entitled to a tax deduction for the same amount.

If the option is an incentive stock option, then the recipient will recognize no
income upon exercise (except for purposes of alternative minimum tax). If the
Common Stock acquired upon exercise is held for at least one year from the date
of exercise and two years from the date of grant of the option, then any gain
realized by the optionee upon sale will be taxed at long-term capital gains
rates. The Company will not be entitled to any deduction in that event. If the
shares are not held for the requisite period, then the option will be treated as
if it had been a nonqualified option: the employee will recognize, in the year
of sale, ordinary income equal to the excess of fair market value of the shares
on the date of exercise over the exercise price, the Company will get a
corresponding deduction and any additional gain will be taxed as capital gain,
long-term or short-term depending on the holding period.

The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders approve the 2001 Option
Plan and intends to introduce at the forthcoming Annual

                                       19
<PAGE>
Meeting the following resolution (designated herein as Proposal 2):

    "RESOLVED, that The AES Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan be hereby
    approved and adopted, effective in accordance with the provisions
    thereunder."

Stockholder approval of the 2001 Option Plan is not required under Delaware law
or under the charter and bylaws of the Company but is being sought in order to
qualify for certain regulatory and tax benefits under New York Stock Exchange
rules and Sections 162(m) and 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.

If stockholders do not approve the 2001 Option Plan, no grants under the 2001
Option Plan will be made to any executive officers.

The affirmative vote of holders representing a majority of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock present or represented at the forthcoming Annual Meeting
is necessary for the adoption of Proposal 2.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE AES CORPORATION
2001 STOCK OPTION PLAN.

PROPOSAL 3
APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF 2001 PLAN FOR OUTSIDE DIRECTORS

The Board of Directors has adopted The AES Corporation 2001 Plan for Outside
Directors (the "2001 Director Plan"), subject to stockholder approval at the
forthcoming Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors believes that the 2001
Director Plan will encourage and promote the growth and prosperity of AES by
helping to attract, retain and reward outside directors of AES with equitable
and competitive compensation opportunities and by sharing in the stock ownership
of AES.

There follows a brief description of the principal features of the 2001 Director
Plan.

SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS. The total number of shares of Common Stock
for which options can be granted pursuant to the 2001 Director Plan is 750,000
shares, subject to adjustment for any merger or other corporation transaction or
event as described below under "RECAPITALIZATION".

AES will reserve, either from authorized but unissued Common Stock or from
Common Stock reacquired by AES and held in its treasury, the full number of
shares of Common Stock necessary to satisfy all options that may be granted
under the 2001 Director Plan.

ADMINISTRATION. The Board of Directors will administer the 2001 Director Plan.
Subject to the provisions of the 2001 Director Plan and such restrictions, if
any, as the Board of Directors may make, the Board of Directors will have
authority to modify, prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating
to the 2001 Director Plan, to construe all plan provisions and to determine any
and all questions arising under the 2001 Director Plan. The determination of the
Board of Directors will be binding and conclusive on all persons.

ELIGIBILITY. Any director of AES who is not an employee of AES or any of its
affiliates will be eligible to participate in the 2001 Director Plan. Currently,
seven directors are eligible for awards under the 2001 Director Plan.

AWARDS. Options may be granted under the 2001 Director Plan in accordance with
the policies established by the Board of Directors from time to time. Currently,
AES's policies provide that each outside director of the Company receive:

                                       20
<PAGE>
- - an initial option as of the date of his or her initial election or appointment
  to the Board of Directors, the grant date value of which is discretionary and
  determined by the Board of Directors at the time of such election or
  appointment ("Initial Options"), and

- - an annual option with a grant date value of $40,000 ("Annual Options").

Each option will be in writing, and such writing will specify the number of
shares of Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to the option and any
conditions under which the option has been granted. In addition, each option
will be subject to the following terms and conditions:

- - The exercise price per share of Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to
  an option will equal 100% of the quoted market price of the Common Stock on
  the date of grant of the option.

- - Each option will expire 10 years after the date of grant of the option, or
  such earlier date as it may no longer be exercised and cannot, by its terms,
  become exercisable.

- - Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the Initial Options
  shall vest and become exercisable at the rate of 20% per year (upon the
  anniversary date of the grant).

- - Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, Annual Options will
  fully vest upon the completion of the outside director's one-year term.

- - Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a "change in control" ("change of control"
  is defined in the same way as in the 2001 Option Plan), all options will
  become fully vested and exercisable.

In addition, each outside director may elect to forgo his or her cash
compensation and be granted an alternative option ("Alternative Option"). The
estimated fair value (used for determining the grant) of an Alternative Option
may be greater than the sum of the fees and the estimated fair value of the
Annual Options. Each outside Director who has elected to receive such an
Alternative Option will be granted an Alternative Option to purchase the number
of whole shares of Common Stock which will have an estimated fair value equal to
the product of (i) the sum of his or her annual fees, the fees for the four
quarterly meetings and the Annual Option estimated fair value, multiplied by
(ii) 1.15. For example, it was decided for 2001 that each outside director will
receive $30,000 in annual fees, an Annual Option grant with an estimated fair
value of $40,000, and four regular meeting fees equal to $8,000 for a total of
$78,000. If a director elects the alternative option, such director would
receive an Alternative Option equal to $89,700 ($78,000 X 1.15 = $89,700).

Each Alternative Option will be in writing, and such writing will specify the
number of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to the
Alternative Option and any conditions under which it has been granted. In
addition, each Alternative Option will be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

- - Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the exercise price per
  share of Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to an Alternative Option
  will equal 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on its date of
  grant.

- - Each Alternative Option will expire 10 years after its date of grant, or such
  earlier date as

                                       21
<PAGE>
  it may no longer be exercised and cannot, by its terms, become exercisable.

- - Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, Alternative Options
  will fully vest upon the completion of the outside director's one-year term.

- - Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon a "change in control", all Alternative
  Options will become fully vested and exercisable.

The number of shares which may be purchased pursuant to an Initial Option, an
Annual Option or an Alternative Option will be determined by the Board of
Directors by applying the "option valuation methodology". The 2001 Director Plan
defines "option valuation methodology" as the method specified by the Board of
Directors from time to time for determining the number of shares of Common Stock
to be subject to an option and, if applicable, the exercise price thereof. The
"option valuation methodology" may be the Black-Scholes option valuation
methodology or such other methodology as may be deemed reasonable by the Board
of Directors.

RECAPITALIZATION. In the event of any merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off,
combination or exchange of shares, or other recapitalization or change in
capitalization or other similar corporate transaction or event that affects
AES's Common Stock or other securities of AES and the Board of Directors
determines that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or
enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available
under the 2001 Director Plan, the Board of Directors will, as it deems equitable
adjust any or all of:

- - the number of shares of Common Stock (or number and kind of other securities
  or property) which may be made the subject of options, including the aggregate
  limits described above under "SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS",

- - the number of shares of Common Stock (or number and kind of other securities
  or property) subject to outstanding options, and

- - the grant, purchase or exercise price with respect to any option.

In the alternative, if deemed appropriate, the Board of Directors will make
provision for a cash payment to an optionee.

In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or other
subdivision or combination of the Common Stock or other securities of the
Company, the items above will be adjusted automatically.

TRANSFERABILITY. No option granted under the 2001 Director Plan will be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of by any optionee or by any other person
having any rights to the option, other than by will or by the laws of descent
and distribution.

NONEXCLUSIVITY. Nothing contained in the 2001 Director Plan will preclude the
Company from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation
arrangements, and any such arrangements may be generally applicable, or
applicable only in specific cases.

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT. The 2001 Director Plan will terminate no later than
January 1, 2011. Notwithstanding this, AES reserves the right to change, amend,
modify or terminate the 2001 Director Plan (or any portion of the 2001 Director
Plan), including without limitation the amount of Initial, Annual or Alternative
Options to be granted to an outside director under the 2001 Director Plan at any
time; PROVIDED

                                       22
<PAGE>
HOWEVER, that AES will not amend the 2001 Director Plan to increase the
aggregate shares available for future grants, other than as provided for above
in "RECAPITALIZATION", without also seeking stockholder approval.

In addition, subject to the terms of the 2001 Director Plan and applicable law,
the Board of Directors may waive any conditions or rights under or change,
amend, modify or terminate any option, prospectively or retroactively.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES. All options granted under the 2001
Director Plan are nonqualified options. The tax consequences of such options are
described above under the description of Proposal 2, "U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES".

The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders approve the 2001
Director Plan and intends to introduce at the forthcoming Annual Meeting the
following resolution (designated herein as Proposal 3):

    "RESOLVED, that The AES Corporation 2001 Plan for Outside Directors be
    hereby approved and adopted, effective in accordance with the provisions
    thereunder."

Stockholder approval of the 2001 Director Plan is not required under Delaware
law or under the charter and bylaws of the Company, but is being sought in order
to qualify for certain regulatory benefits under New York Stock Exchange rules.
If stockholders do not approve the 2001 Director Plan, it will not be adopted.

The affirmative vote of holders representing a majority of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock present or represented at the forthcoming Annual Meeting
is necessary for the adoption of Proposal 3.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF THE AES CORPORATION
2001 PLAN FOR OUTSIDE DIRECTORS.

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS

Any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors and who meets the
requirements of the proxy rules under the Exchange Act may submit to the Board
of Directors proposals to be considered for submission to the stockholders at
the Year 2002 Annual Meeting. Any such proposal should be submitted in writing
by notice delivered or mailed by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid
to the Secretary, The AES Corporation, 1001 North 19th Street, Arlington,
Virginia 22209 and must be received no later than November 22, 2001 in
compliance with new regulations promulgated by the Commission. Any such notice
shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder and the text of the
proposal to be introduced; (b) the number of shares of stock held of record,
owned beneficially and represented by proxy by such stockholder as of the date
of such notice; and (c) a representation that the stockholder intends to appear
in person or by proxy at the meeting to introduce the proposal specified in the
notice. The chairperson of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the
introduction of any stockholder proposal not made in compliance with the
foregoing procedure.

AES's By-Laws contain a procedure for stockholder nomination of directors. The
By-Laws provide that any record owner of stock entitled to be voted generally in
the election of directors may nominate one or more persons for election as a
director at a stockholders meeting only if written notice is given to the
Secretary of AES of the intent to make such nomination. The

                                       23
<PAGE>
notice must be given, with respect to an annual meeting, not later than 90 days
in advance of such annual meeting and with respect to a special meeting, not
later than the close of business on the seventh day following the earlier of (a)
the date on which notice of such special meeting is first given to stockholders
and (b) the date on which a public announcement of such meeting is first made.
Each notice must include (i) the name and address of each stockholder who
intends to appear in person or by proxy to make the nomination and of the person
or persons to be nominated; (ii) a description of all arrangements or
understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or
persons (naming them) pursuant to which the nomination is to be made by the
stockholder; (iii) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by
such stockholder as would have been included in a proxy statement filed pursuant
to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act; and (iv) the consent of each nominee to
serve if elected. The presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge
the nomination of any person not made in compliance with this procedure. The
procedure for stockholder nomination of directors described above may have the
effect of precluding a nomination for election of directors at a particular
meeting if the required procedure is not followed.

GENERAL

Deloitte & Touche LLP has been engaged as the Company's independent auditors for
2001. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual
Meeting and will be given an opportunity to make a statement. They also will be
available to respond to appropriate questions.

On November 15, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new auditor
independence rules, including new requirements for disclosing audit and
non-audit fees in proxy statements. The following chart outlines fees billed
during the year ended December 31, 2000 by Deloitte and Touche LLP:

    provision of these services is compatible with maintaining Deloitte and
    Touche LLP's independence, and concluded that these services are compatible.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

Proxies will be solicited by mail, telephone, or other means of communication.
The Company has retained the services of First Chicago Trust Company of New York

proxies from stockholders for a fee, including its expenses, estimated at
$6,000. In addition, solicitation can be made by directors, officers, and

Attachment I

                              THE AES CORPORATION
                    CHARTER OF THE FINANCIAL AUDIT COMMITTEE

MEMBERSHIP

    The Financial Audit Committee ("Committee") shall be appointed by the Board
of Directors (the "Board") and be comprised entirely of outside Directors of the
Board who are generally knowledgeable in financial and auditing matters,
including at least one member with accounting or related financial management
expertise. Each member shall be independent and, in the opinion of the Board,
free of any relationship that would interfere with their exercise of independent
judgment. The Committee shall review and assess the adequacy of this charter
annually, and shall make such changes necessary to comply with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock
Exchange and any other appropriate regulatory body.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

    The Committee's purpose is the review and oversight of the Company's
performance with respect to its financial responsibilities and the integrity of
the Company's accounting and reporting practices, focusing particularly in areas
that require exercise of judgment. The Committee shall assure the Board that to
the best of its knowledge, financial matters of the Company are being dealt with
consistent with the mission of the Company and its shared principles of Fun,
Fairness, Social Responsibility and Integrity.

    The Company--not the Committee or the independent auditor--is responsible
for the financial statements and its operating results and for the appropriate
safekeeping of the Company's assets. The independent auditor's responsibility is
to attest to the fair presentation of the financial statements. The independent
auditor shall be accountable to the Board and the Committee, and the Board and
the Committee shall have the ultimate authority and responsibility to select,
evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the independent auditor.

    The role of the Committee is to be satisfied that both the Company and the
independent auditor discharge their respective responsibilities effectively.

RESPONSIBILITIES

    In carrying out its duties, the Committee shall review the Company's annual
audited financial statements prior to filing or distribution, and discuss with
the independent auditor, the Company's financial officers and other appropriate
members of the Company their qualitative judgments about the appropriateness,
not just the acceptability, of accounting principles and the clarity of
financial disclosure practices used or proposed to be adopted by the Company.
The Committee shall also solicit

                                      A-1
<PAGE>
the independent auditor's views as to the degree of aggressiveness or
conservatism of the Company's choices of accounting principles, including
whether these principles are common or minority practices. In addition, the
Committee shall discuss with the independent auditors any information required
to be communicated by the independent auditors in accordance with AICPA SAS 71.

    The Committee shall advise the Company in general on its financial reporting
process, the external audit process, risk analysis and AES's internal review
process. The Committee shall report to the Board such matters that come to its
attention, including conflicts of interest, the use of Company funds for any
unauthorized or illegal payments, and any other questionable business practices.

    The Committee shall cause the Board to be informed, on a timely basis, of
significant developments in accounting principles affecting the Company as well
as relevant rulings by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other
regulatory bodies. In performing such responsibility it shall rely on the
support of the Company, the independent auditors, legal counsel of the Company
and the people responsible for the financial reporting of the Company.

    The Committee shall cause the independent auditors to provide a formal
written statement delineating all relationships between the Company and the
internal auditors, and shall discuss those relationships with the independent
auditors. The Committee will recommend to the Board any appropriate action
necessary to satisfy itself of the independence of the internal auditors.

TERMS OF APPOINTMENT

    Committee membership shall begin on the first day of an eligible Board
member's day of appointment to the Committee by the Board. Membership shall end
on the last day of such Board member's term.

REPORTING AND MEETING

    The Committee will report to the full Board at least once annually. The
Committee shall meet at least (2) times a year to fulfill its obligations, or
more frequently as circumstances dictate.

DECISION-MAKING

    The Committee shall be responsible for reviewing and recommending matters
related to its duties to the Board, including the selection of the independent
auditor. Final decision-making on all matters shall be vested in the entire
Board.
