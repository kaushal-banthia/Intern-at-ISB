PROXY STATEMENT

March 30, 1999

The  accompanying  proxy  is  solicited  by the  Board of  Directors  of The AES
Corporation  (the  "Company"  or  "AES")  for  use  at  the  Annual  Meeting  of
Stockholders  of the Company to be held on Tuesday,  April 20, 1999 at 9:30 a.m.
at the  Company's  corporate  offices  at 1001  North  19th  Street,  Arlington,
Virginia 22209, or at any adjournment of such meeting.  This Proxy Statement and
accompanying  proxy are first  being sent or given to  stockholders  on or about
March 30, 1999.

If the proxy is properly executed and returned by mail, the shares it represents
will be voted at the meeting in accordance with the instructions  noted thereon.
If no instructions  are specified,  the shares will be voted for the election of
the directors and in accordance with the Board of Directors'  recommendations as
set forth herein.  Any stockholder  executing a proxy has the power to revoke it
at any time before it is voted by filing  with the  Company a written  notice of
revocation,  by  delivering a duly  executed  proxy  bearing a later date, or by
attending  the Annual  Meeting  of  Stockholders  and voting in person.  Proxies
marked as abstentions, or to withhold a vote from a nominee as a director in the
case of the  election  of  directors,  will have the effect of a negative  vote.
Broker  non-votes (where a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner has not
received  voting  instructions  from the  beneficial  owner  with  respect  to a
particular  matter and such  nominee  does not possess or choose to exercise his
discretionary  authority with respect  thereto) will be considered as present at
the meeting but not entitled to vote with respect to the  particular  matter and
will therefore have no effect.

The only  securities  of the  Company  entitled to be voted are shares of Common
Stock,  and only  holders of record of Common  Stock at the close of business on
March 3, 1999 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the  meeting.  Holders of
Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share.  There were 180,587,044  shares
of Common  Stock  outstanding  at the close of  business  on March 3, 1999.  The
Company's  Annual  Report for the fiscal year ended  December  31, 1998 is being
delivered concurrently with this Proxy Statement.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

Directors  who are also  officers  of AES are not  paid  any fees or  additional
compensation for service as members of AES's Board of Directors or any committee
thereof.  Each  director who is not  employed by AES received  $30,000 as annual
cash compensation for service on the Board of Directors for 1998, and $1,000 for
each board  meeting  attended in person and $500 for each meeting in which he or
she participated by telephone  conference.  For 1999, the Director's annual cash
compensation  is $30,000.  The  directors  may elect to defer this  compensation
pursuant to the Deferred  Compensation  Plan for  Directors in the form of stock
units.  All  directors  are  reimbursed  for travel and other  related  expenses
incurred  in  attending  Board and  committee  meetings.  Directors  who are not
employed by AES are not eligible to participate in AES's employee  benefit plans
but participate in The AES Corporation  Stock Option Plan for Outside  Directors
which was  adopted  in 1992.  Under the terms of the plan,  the  Company  issues
options to purchase  shares of the  Company's  Common  Stock at a price equal to
100% of the fair  market  value on the date the  option  is  granted.  Directors
eligible to participate in the plan receive options  annually to purchase common
stock valued at 83.3% of the annual fees payable to directors,  as determined by
the Black-Scholes  formula on a basis consistent with the Company's stock option
program.  These options become  eligible for exercise in  installments of 50% at
the end of each of the first two years.


COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD

The  Board  has  four  standing  committees:  the Financial Audit Committee, the
Environmental,  Safety  and  Social  Responsibility  Committee,  the  Nominating
Committee, and the Compensation Committee.

The Financial  Audit  Committee  recommends  which firm will be appointed by the
Board of Directors as independent auditor to examine AES's financial  statements
and to perform  services  related to the audit.  The Financial  Audit  Committee
reviews  the  scope and  results  of the audit  with the  independent  auditors,
reviews with the Company and the independent auditors AES's interim and year-end
operating results, considers the adequacy of the internal accounting and control
procedures  of AES,  reviews  any  non-audit  services  to be  performed  by the
independent  auditors  and  considers  the  effect  of such  performance  on the
auditors' independence. The Financial Audit Committee met once in 1998.


The Environmental, Safety and Social Responsibility Committee was created by the
Board in January  1997.  It monitors the  environmental  and safety  compliance,
respectively,  of the Company and its  subsidiaries and reviews and approves the
scope of the  Company's  internal  environmental  and  safety  compliance  audit
programs to consider  the  adequacy and  appropriateness  of the programs  being
planned and performed,  as well as periodically reviews the Company's commitment
to, and implementation  of, its principle to act in a socially  responsible way.
The Environmental, Safety and Social Responsibility Committee met twice in 1998.


The Nominating  Committee provides  recommendations for potential nomination for
election  of new members of the Board of  Directors.  The  Nominating  Committee
considers potential  nominations  provided by stockholders and submits suggested
nominations,  when  appropriate,  to the Board of Directors  for  approval.  The
Nominating  Committee  did not meet in 1998.  Stockholders  wishing to recommend
persons for  consideration by the Nominating  Committee as nominees for election
to the Company's Board of Directors can do so by writing to the Secretary of the
Company at 1001 North 19th Street,  Arlington,  Virginia 22209, giving each such
person's name,  biographical data and  qualifications.  Any such  recommendation
should be accompanied by a written statement from the person  recommended of his
or her consent to be named as a nominee and, if nominated and elected,  to serve
as a director. The Company's By-Laws also contain a procedure for


                                       6
<PAGE>

stockholder  nomination  of directors. (See "Submission of Stockholder Proposals
and Nominations" below.)

The Compensation Committee establishes rates of salary,  bonuses, profit sharing
contributions,  grants of stock options,  retirement and other  compensation for
all  directors  and  officers of AES and for such other  people as the Board may
designate.  All of the members of this  committee  are  "disinterested  persons"
under the provisions of Rule 16b-3 adopted under the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act").  The  Compensation  Committee's  primary
responsibility  is to formulate  and maintain  the  compensation  program of the
Company  in order to  develop,  retain  (and  attract,  when  necessary)  people
important to the Company's  performance.  This  committee  specifically  acts to
evaluate  the  performance  and set the  total  compensation  for the  executive
officers of the Company,  including the CEO, in accordance  with the  guidelines
discussed  below.  This  committee  has  delegated  to the CEO the  power to set
compensation for the non-executive officers. The Compensation Committee met once
in 1998.


COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The Compensation  Committee's (the  "Committee")  guidelines for compensation of
executive  officers are designed to provide fair and competitive levels of total
compensation  while  integrating  pay  with  performance.   Executive  officers,
including  the CEO,  are  evaluated  annually  on the  basis of both  individual
responsibilities  and  contributions,  as well as  Company-wide  results  in two
related  areas:  (i)  corporate  culture (or  principles)  and (ii)  business or
functional area performance.

There  are  three  elements  in the  Company's  executive  officer  compensation
program. These elements are:

       o Base salary

       o Annual incentive compensation

       o Stock option program

Base  salary is  adjusted  annually  by the  Committee  to account  for  general
economic and cost of living changes.  Adjustments are also made  periodically to
recognize significant new or additional responsibilities of individual executive
officers.  The  Committee's  guidelines are to provide base salary  compensation
generally   consistent  with  its   interpretation   of  industry  averages  for
individuals with similar responsibility levels.

Annual  incentive  compensation  is based  upon both  objective  and  subjective
measures in the areas of  corporate  culture and  business  or  functional  area
performance,  and generally  takes the form of bonuses  payable after  year-end.
With respect to corporate culture,  the Company's shared principles of fairness,
integrity,  fun and social  responsibility  are integral to its  operations  and
serve as its founding principles. These principles apply equally to the internal
activities of the Company as well as its external relationships.  Each executive
officer's  individual  contribution to demonstrating  and nurturing these shared
values is reviewed and  considered as a factor in determining  annual  incentive
compensation.   Evaluations  by  the  Committee  in  this  area  are  inherently
subjective.

The second area considered in the determination of annual incentive compensation
is the individual  executive  officer's  performance  with respect to his or her
related business  responsibilities  and/or functional area. Although all aspects
of  an  individual's  responsibilities  are  considered  in  determining  annual
incentive compensation,  several quantitative measures of annual performance are
considered  significant,  including  operating  margin  improvements,  operating
reliability,  earnings per share contributions,  environmental performance,  and
plant and Company-wide  safety. The qualitative  factors considered  significant
include business and project development progress,  effective strategic planning
and implementation,  Company-wide support, understanding of and adherence to the
Company's values, and community relations and people development.


                                       7
<PAGE>

Important  strategic  successes or failures can take several  years to translate
into  objectively  measurable  results.  The Committee  does not compute  annual
incentive   compensation   using  a  mathematical   formula  of   pre-determined
performance goals and objective criteria.  As a result, the Committee's ultimate
determination of the amount, if any, of annual incentive compensation is made at
the end of each year based on a subjective  evaluation  of several  quantitative
and qualitative factors,  with primary emphasis given this year to those factors
listed in the  preceding  paragraph.  There are no targeted,  minimum or maximum
levels  of  annual  incentive  compensation,  and  such  compensation  does  not
necessarily  bear  any  consistent  relationship  to  salary  amounts  or  total
compensation.

The  Company's  stock option  program is used to reward people for the corporate
responsibilities  they undertake,  their performance of those duties and to help
them to think and act like owners.  All executive officers and approximately 69%
of the total people in the Company  located in the United States  (approximately
7% of AES people worldwide) participate in this program.  Historically,  because
of differing legal  environments  in many countries,  options had been primarily
granted to U.S.  people.  However,  the Company  has taken steps to  incorporate
those  people who  reside  outside of the  United  States  into this  program by
qualifying  its stock  option plan in each  country  where AES people  currently
reside or work, and the Company expects the total  participation  to increase in
the future.  Stock options are usually granted annually at the fair market value
on the date of grant and provide  vesting periods to reward people for continued
service to the Company.  The Committee's  determination of the number of options
to be  granted to  executive  officers  is based  upon the same  factors as such
officer's  annual  incentive   compensation   discussed  above  with  additional
consideration given to the number of options previously granted.

Since 1994,  the Company has  participated  in an annual survey  conducted by an
outside  consulting firm which encompasses over 400 public  companies.  Based in
part on the survey results, the Committee  established  guidelines for suggested
ranges of option grants to executive  officers as well as the rest of the people
in the Company.  Based on the survey, the Committee established guideline ranges
for  eligible  participants  between  the 50th and 90th  percentile  of  similar
companies.  As with  annual  incentive  compensation,  the  determination  of an
individual's  grant is subjective  and although the  Committee  has  established
suggested guidelines, the grants are not formula based.

Total compensation is reviewed to determine whether amounts are competitive with
other companies  whose  operations are similar in type, size and complexity with
those of the  Company,  as well as a broad range of similarly  sized  companies.
Comparisons are made with published amounts, where available,  and, from time to
time, the Company also participates in various  industry-sponsored  compensation
surveys in addition to the public-company  survey described above. The Committee
also  has,  in the past,  engaged  an  independent  compensation  consultant  to
specifically   review  the  level  and   appropriateness  of  executive  officer
compensation.  Other than as  described  above,  the Company uses the results of
surveys,  when available,  for  informational  purposes only and does not target
individual  elements of or total  compensation  to any specific  range of survey
results  (i.e.,  high,  low or  median)  other  than the  Committee's  suggested
guidelines  for stock option  grants as  discussed  in the  previous  paragraph.
Because each individual's compensation is determined, in part, by experience and
performance, actual compensation generally varies from industry averages.

Executive  officers also  participate  in the Company's  profit sharing plan (or
deferred  compensation  plan for  executive  officers)  on the same terms as all
other people in the Company,  subject to any legal  limitations  on amounts that
may be  contributed  or benefits  that may be payable  under the plan.  Matching
contributions and annual


                                       8
<PAGE>

profit  sharing  contributions  are made with the common stock of the Company to
further encourage long-term performance. In addition, certain individuals of the
Company  participate  in  the  Company's  supplemental  retirement  plan,  which
provides supplemental  retirement benefits to "highly compensated employees" (as
defined in the Internal  Revenue Code) of any amount which would be  contributed
on such  individual's  behalf  under the profit  sharing  plan (or the  deferred
compensation plan for executive  officers) but is not so contributed  because of
the limitations contained in the Internal Revenue Code.

In most  cases,  the  Committee  has taken  steps to qualify  income paid to any
officer as a deductible  business expense pursuant to regulations  issued by the
Internal  Revenue  Service  pursuant to Section 162 (m) of the Internal  Revenue
Code with  respect to  qualifying  compensation  paid to  executive  officers in
excess of $1 million.  Compensation  earned  pursuant to the exercise of options
granted under the Company's  former stock option plan (which was discontinued in
1991) is not  considered  for purposes of the $1 million  aggregate  limit,  and
exercises  under  the 1991  Plan are  similarly  excluded.  The  Committee  will
continue  to  consider  the  implications  to  the  Company  of  qualifying  all
compensation  as a  deductible  expense  under  Section 162 (m), but retains the
discretion to pay bonuses commensurate with an executive officer's contributions
to the success of the Company, irrespective of whether such amounts are entirely
deductible.

MR. BAKKE'S 1998 COMPENSATION

Mr.  Bakke's  compensation  for  1998 was reviewed and approved by the Committee
utilizing  the guidelines discussed above. Specifically, the following primarily
positive factors considered were:

o   Strong adherence,  understanding, and awareness by the people in the Company
    to its shared principles of integrity,  fairness,  social responsibility and
    fun, as indicated by the Company's  internal values survey,  with particular
    emphasis  made  on  excellent   progress  made  at  the  Company's   foreign
    subsidiaries.

o   Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 68% and 55% from 1997 to
    1998, respectively.


o   Significant   development   of  new  project  and  business   opportunities,
    including:


    o   the acquisition of CLESA, a distribution company in El Salvador

    o   the acquisition of Eletropaulo  Metropolitana,  the distribution company
        for Sao Paolo, Brazil by an affiliate of AES

    o   the acquisition of three  generating  stations  totalling  approximately
        4,000 MW from Southern California Edison

    o   the  acquisition of Edelap,  a  distribution  company in the province of
        Buenos Aires, Argentina

    o   agreements to acquire businesses in India, Panama,  Argentina,  Illinois
        (U.S.) and New York (U.S.)

    o   commencement  of operations at numerous  facilities,  including those in
        China, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Argentina

    o   numerous   project   development   successes   represented   by  project
        financings,  start of  construction  or successful bid awards in Mexico,
        Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Argentina

    o   Successful  public  issuance of  approximately  $200  million  aggregate
        principal  amount of senior notes,  $150 million of  convertible  junior
        subordinated debentures, and $190 million of common stock.

o   Successful resolution of Pakistan political dispute

o   An  exceptional  year in  plant  reliability  and  availability  across  the
    Company.



                                       9
<PAGE>

o   Continued  excellent  environmental  performance  below permitted levels (on
    average).

o   An increase in total net megawatts in operation,  in  construction  or under
    advanced development from approximately 18,000 to 27,000.


The following primarily negative factors considered were:

o   While the  Company's  overall  safety  record  continued to improve in 1998,
    several very serious  injuries  occurred,  including  six (five  amongst the
    Company's contractors) that resulted in loss of life.

o   An increase in the price of the Company's stock of 1%,  including a mid-year
    drop of almost 60%.

Mr. Bakke's 1998 cash compensation decreased 71% over 1997 cash compensation, as
compared to a total cash compensation increase of approximately 52% from 1996 to
1997.  However,  total  compensation  for  1998,  including  the  grant of stock
options, increased approximately 33%.

The Committee  decided that,  beginning in 1999, Mr.  Bakke's cash  compensation
would be  reduced to $0. Mr.  Bakke will be  compensated  solely by the grant of
stock options (in lieu of a cash salary and cash bonus).  The Committee believes
that this  method of  compensation  will  align Mr.  Bakke's  compensation  more
closely with the financial interests of the Company's other shareholders.

(1) All options are for shares of Common Stock of the Company.  Options  granted
    for services  performed in 1998 were granted at the fair market value on the
    date of grant, and vest at the rate of 50% per year through December 2000.

(2) The  Black-Scholes  stock option  pricing  model was used to value the stock
    options on the grant date  (February  2, 1999).  The  Company's  assumptions
    under this model include an expected volatility of 48.55%, a 4.66% risk free
    rate of return and no dividends.  The options have 10 year terms and vest at
    50%  per  year.  There  were no  adjustments  made to  account  for  vesting
    provisions,  and no adjustments were made for non-transferability or risk of
    forfeiture.

  The use of such  amounts and  assumptions  are not  intended  to forecast  any
  possible future appreciation of the Company's stock price or dividend policy.

SECTION 16 (A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Based solely on the Company's review of reports filed under Section 16(a) of the
Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934  and  certain  representations,  the  Company
believes  that in 1998 there were no reports which were not reported on a timely
basis and no known failure to file a required form,  except that Dr. Emerson did
not timely  report the  purchase of 423 shares on Form 4; Mr.  Hanrahan  did not
timely  report the sale of 21,998  shares from his AES Profit  Sharing and Stock
Ownership Plan account on Form 4; Mr. McMillen did not timely report the sale of
10,000  shares on Form 4; Mr.  Prieto did not  timely  report the sale of 21,902
shares on Form 4; and Ms. Slusser did not timely report the sale of 4,324 shares
from her AES Profit Sharing and Stock Ownership Plan account on Form 4.

PROPOSAL 2
APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS

The  Board  of  Directors  has  appointed  Deloitte  &  Touche  LLP,  a firm  of
independent   public   accountants,   as  auditors  to  examine  and  report  to
stockholders for the year 1999. Deloitte & Touche LLP has acted as the Company's
independent   auditors   since  1981.   The   appointment   was  made  upon  the
recommendation  of the  Financial  Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors.
Representatives  of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual  Meeting
and  will be  given  an  opportunity  to make a  statement.  They  also  will be
available to respond to appropriate questions.

The Board of Directors  recommends that the stockholders  ratify the appointment
of Deloitte & Touche LLP,  and intends to introduce  at the  forthcoming  Annual
Meeting the following resolution (designated herein as Proposal 2):

    "RESOLVED,  that the appointment by the Board of Directors of Deloitte &
    Touche LLP as independent auditors for this Company for the year 1999 is
    hereby approved, ratified and confirmed."

The  affirmative  vote of the  holders of a majority  of shares of Common  Stock
entitled  to notice of and to vote at the  Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders,  at
which a quorum is present,  is necessary for the ratification of the appointment
of Deloitte & Touche LLP as  independent  auditors  for the Company for the year
1999.


SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS

Any stockholder  entitled to vote in the election of directors and who meets the
requirements  of the proxy rules under the  Exchange Act may submit to the Board
of Directors  proposals to be considered for submission to the  stockholders  at
the Year 2000 Annual  Meeting.  Any such proposal should be submitted in writing
by notice  delivered  or mailed  by  first-class  United  States  mail,  postage
prepaid,  to the  Secretary,  The  AES  Corporation,  1001  North  19th  Street,
Arlington,  Virginia  22209 and must be received no later than February 13, 2000
in compliance  with new  regulations  promulgated  by the  Commission.  Any such
notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder and the text
of the  proposal  to be  introduced;  (b) the  number of shares of stock held of
record,  owned  beneficially  and represented by proxy by such stockholder as of
the date of such notice; and (c) a representation  that the stockholder  intends
to appear  in  person  or by proxy at the  meeting  to  introduce  the  proposal
specified  in  the  notice.  The  chairperson  of  the  meeting  may  refuse  to
acknowledge the introduction of any stockholder  proposal not made in compliance
with the foregoing procedure.

AES's By-Laws contain a procedure for stockholder  nomination of directors.  The
By-Laws provide that any record owner of stock entitled to be voted generally in
the  election of  directors  may  nominate one or more persons for election as a
director  at a  stockholders  meeting  only if  written  notice  is given to the
Secretary  of AES of the  intent to make such  nomination.  The  notice  must be
given,  with respect to an annual meeting,  not later than 90 days in advance of
such annual


                                       15
<PAGE>

meeting  and with  respect  to a special  meeting,  not later  than the close of
business  on the  seventh  day  following  the  earlier of (a) the date on which
notice of such special meeting is first given to  stockholders  and (b) the date
on which a public  announcement  of such meeting is first made. Each notice must
include  (i) the name and address of each  stockholder  who intends to appear in
person or by proxy to make the  nomination  and of the  person or  persons to be
nominated;  (ii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
stockholder  and each  nominee  and any other  person or persons  (naming  them)
pursuant to which the  nomination is to be made by the  stockholder;  (iii) such
other  information  regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would
have been included in a proxy  statement  filed pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange  Act;  and (iv) the consent of each  nominee to serve if  elected.  The
presiding officer of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any
person not made in compliance with this procedure. The procedure for stockholder
nomination  of  directors  described  above may have the effect of  precluding a
nomination  for election of  directors  at a particular  meeting if the required
procedure is not followed.


SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

Proxies will be solicited by mail,  telephone,  or other means of communication.
The Company has retained the services of First Chicago Trust Company of New York
and Corporate  Investor  Communications,  Inc. to assist in the  solicitation of
proxies  from  stockholders  for a fee,  including  its  expenses,  estimated at
$5,000.  In  addition,  solicitation  may be made by  directors,  officers,  and
regular  employees of the Company.  The Company will reimburse  brokerage firms,
custodians,  nominees,  and  fiduciaries  in  accordance  with the  rules of the
National  Association  of Securities  Dealers,  Inc.,  for  reasonable  expenses
incurred by them in forwarding materials to the beneficial owners of shares. The
entire cost of solicitation will be borne by the Company.
