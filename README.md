# Intern at ISB
 <b>Winter Intern at ISB</b>

Created a program that found out clusters of keywords located in the DEF 14A files of S&P 500 companies.<br>
Then compared the paragraphs (found via the clustering algorithm used) to a set of keywords that hinted the CEO's compensation being based on socio - economic factors.<br>
Finally made a dataset that contained the name of each of the 5000+ files and the number of time the keywords appear in them.<br>
