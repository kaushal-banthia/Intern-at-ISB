Created a program that found out clusters of keywords located in the DEF 14A files of S&P 500 companies.
Then compared the paragraphs (found via the clustering algorithm used) to a set of keywords that hinted the CEO's compensation being based on socio - economic factors.

Finally made a dataset that contained the name of each of the 5000+ files and the number of time the keywords appear in them
